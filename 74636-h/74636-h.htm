<div><h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER I</h2></div>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>As long ago as the year 1710 there lived in
London town a girl of the name of Anne Champion—a
straw-plaiter by trade, and by hard
fortune a beauty. Anne lived alone in a garret,
and earned her bread by the sweat of her
brow, plaiting straws for hats from early morning
to late at night. Then she would go out
and buy her food for the next day, if she had
earned enough to buy food with, and if she had
not, she would do without food and work on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A hard life enough; but it was not to last
for ever. For Anne had a fine lover at the
wars—Surgeon Sebastian Shepley,—and ere
very long he was to return, and Anne was to
say farewell to work. Partings were partings
in those days, and Anne never thought of getting
a letter from Flanders more than once in
seven or eight weeks. When she got one, poor
girl, she could not read it—no, nor answer it;
for she had no ‘book-learning,’ and had never
been taught to write; but she used to take her
letters to a former adorer of her own who served
in a print-shop, and he kindly read his rival’s
love-letters aloud, and, when Anne could afford
to send one in return, would even be forgiving
enough to write it for her. Anne’s fine lover
had caused considerable jealousy among her
neighbours, and old Mrs. Nare, the mother of
Matthew, the young man in the news-shop, was
never tired of hinting to Anne that no good
ever came of such unequal alliances. When she
saw that Anne was quite undisturbed by these
prognostications, Mrs. Nare tried to persuade
her that there was little chance Shepley would
ever return from the wars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘The surgeons do come by their deaths in
war-time so well as the soldiers,’ she would
say; ‘best not set your heart overly on him,
Anne.’ And Anne would whiten, and turn
away at her words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yard’s Entry, where Anne Champion and
Mrs. Nare lived, is a place that smells of age
now—it was counted old even in these far-away
days I write of,—and the stone stairs leading
up to Anne’s garret were worn away into crescent
shape by the tread of many generations.
At the foot of these stairs, on warm evenings,
Mrs. Nare used to stand and watch all her
neighbours’ affairs; so it was natural enough
that a stranger coming in to the Entry one
evening should address himself to her when he
made inquiry for Anne Champion. He was a
young man with very bright eyes, and his voice,
as clear as the note of a flute, echoed up the
stair as he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Doth Anne Champion live here, my good
woman?’ he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘No, sir. Anne she lives at the top of the
stair,’ said Mrs. Nare, squinting up at the
stranger out of her narrow old eyes, then, actuated
by unknown motives, she added—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Anne she’ve got a lover at the wars,’ in a
sort of interrogative tone. She had seen Shepley
more than once, and knew this was not he;
perhaps she wished to find out the stranger’s
errand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Thank you, thank you,’ was all he said, however,
as he disappeared up the winding old
stair. Up and up he went, feeling his way, for
there was little or no light to guide him, then
he stumbled against a door, and knocked at
haphazard, hoping it was the door he sought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Come in,’ said some one, and at that the
man, groping with the latch for a moment, at
last got the door open, and stood on the threshold
looking in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sunshine fell across the floor in a flood of
smoky brightness, and full in the sun’s beams
sat Anne Champion, surrounded by the straw
she was plaiting. It was piled up round her,
within reach of her fingers, that moved like
lightning at her mechanical toil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anne wore a gown of pink calico, and,
whether for greater comfort or from mere untidiness,
all her yellow hair hung over her shoulders
in splendid confusion. She let her work
fall at sight of a stranger, started up, and standing
almost knee-deep among the straw, caught
at her hair, and began to wind it up into a knot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man stood still on the threshold
for a full minute, as I have said. Then he
seemed to recollect himself, and stepping across
the floor he held out his hand to the girl, smiling
very pleasantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I scarce need to ask if you are Anne Champion,’
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anne seemed too much taken aback by this
unexpected visitor to make any reply. She
stood looking at him and twisting her long yellow
hair between her fingers. At last she said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Yes, sir, I be Anne Champion,’ and waited
for him to make known his errand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man did not seem to be in any
hurry, however. He looked round the bare
little room, and then looked again at Anne
before he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I am come to make excuses,’ he said then;
‘and if you will allow me to sit down, for I am
weak still from a fever, I shall make them to
the best of my ability.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anne produced a stool from a corner and
proffered it to her visitor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I am come from Flanders,’ he began again;
but he did not speak like one intent on his business:
his bright eyes were fixed on Anne; he
seemed to be speaking of one thing and thinking
of another. His words, however, had a
quick effect on Anne—her look of perplexed
shyness had vanished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘From Flanders? Ah, sir, ’tis welcome
thrice over you are!’ she cried; ‘an’ are you
bringing me news of my dear man?’ Her face
was radiant; she smiled, and the beautiful
dimples in her cheek were revealed, and her
white even teeth. Her very eyes seemed to
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man began to speak again—with
unaccountable stumblings and hesitations, still
reading Anne’s face with his quick bright eyes
as he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I am come—Sebastian Shepley,’ he said,
and paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the sight of his perturbation Anne came
quickly towards him and laid her hand on his
shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Sir, sir,’ she cried. ‘Don’t tell me as there
is aught amiss with my Sebastian.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Anne, I am come from your old lover Shepley,
as you surmise,’ began the young man
again; ‘he—he is well in health.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>The colour which had left Anne’s face rushed
back to it in a beautiful scarlet tide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Lord! sir, Sebastian’s not old, begging
your pardon, sir,’ she said, letting her hand
fall from his shoulder, rather ashamed of her
sudden familiarity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I—’twas not that way I meant it, Anne;
I scarce know,’ stammered the young man.
‘Come, sit down by me and I shall tell you
all.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anne, however, would not have felt easy sitting
down in the presence of this fine stranger
in lace ruffles. She stood opposite him and still
looked anxious in spite of his assurances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘There hath ill come to him, sir; he’s
wounded; or—or—’ she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man seemed suddenly to have
collected himself; his embarrassment, if embarrassment
it had been, vanished as suddenly
as it had come. He rose and came over to
where Anne stood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘He hath no wound nor hurt of any sort,
Anne, but he hath sent me with a message to
you, and this is it:—The war is like to keep
him so long in the Low Country he dare not
ask you to wait.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I’d wait a lifetime for him,’ laughed Anne.
‘If that be all his message he hath troubled you
for naught, sir.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘ ’Tis not all. The fact is Sebastian has married—married
a pretty Dutch wife. He feared
to exhaust your patience. He asked me to
tell you. “For,” said he, “Anne hath so
many lovers ’twill be neither here nor there to
her.” As like as not he may be years abroad still.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a moment’s silence. Anne looked
her visitor straight in the eyes; she had whitened
down to her very lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You are but fooling with me, sir,’ she said,
half whispering the words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I am in sober earnest; ’tis no matter for
jest this,’ said the young man, looking at
Anne’s blanching cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘O good Lord!’ then cried Anne in a piteous
crying voice—the note of a bird over its harried
nest. She seemed to forget the presence of a
stranger, and, sinking down against a settle
that stood by the wall, she hid her face in her
hands and sobbed, rocking herself back and
forwards in her bitter grief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Sebastian, Sebastian dear, you are not wedded
true and certain?’ she cried. ‘O God
help me, an’ what am I to do now? O Lord!
O Lord!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man who had brought this ill
news did not go away and leave Anne alone
with her sorrow, as most men would have done.
He sat down on the settle she leant against and
laid his hand kindly on her shoulder though he
said nothing. Anne sobbed on, with hidden
face, and all the time her visitor’s bright eyes
were roving round the room, taking in every
detail of its poor arrangements, yet ever and
again he would pat the girl’s shoulder in token
of sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Anne rose to her feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘He’s not worth a tear,’ she said. ‘He’s
like the rest of you. I had no opinion of men
before that I took up with Sebastian, an’ a fool
I was to be deceived with him. You’re all
like that,’ she cried, pointing to the pile of
straw at her feet. ‘A spark’ll send you up in
a blaze, and you’re as much to be leaned on
as that.’ She plucked a straw from the heap,
and snapped the brittle yellow stalk across as she
spoke, with an unconsciously dramatic gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Come, not all,’ said the young man, surprised
by her words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Yes, all. Well, this I do say for Sebastian,
he’s as fine a liar as he was a lover—would take
in Judas hisself with them straight eyes o’ his.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I am grieved to have borne such bitter news
to any one,’ said the young man. ‘But you
take it the right way, Anne, and when Shepley
returns ’twill be to find a better man in his
place.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Better man! There’s not one good among
’em—no, not one,’ said Anne, bitterly. She
walked away to the little window, through
which the sunshine was pouring in with garish
brightness, and leant her forehead against the
panes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Come, Anne,’ urged her visitor, following
her to the window. ‘You must do your endeavour
to forget him. ’Tis a scurvy trick he
has played you, but there’s a proverb suited to
your case I would have you remember, about
the good fish in the sea! Come, here is a coin
as yellow as your hair to help you to the forgetting.
Buy yourself a new gown with ribbands
and have a night at the play.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anne looked askance at the stranger’s gold
for a moment; then she flung back her head
and laughed a harsh-sounding mirthless laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I had best make sure ’tis gold I’ve got this
time!’ she said, catching up the coin and ringing
it on the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I shall bid you good-night then, my good
girl,’ said the stranger, and held out his hand
once again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A minute later he plunged down the dark old
stair. ‘What is it like? going down thus into
darkness?’ he said to himself; but he did not
reply to the question.</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER II</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>The young man Richard Meadowes found a
coach waiting for him round the corner of
Yard’s Entry; he jumped in and bade the
coachman drive home to St. James’ Square: a
long drive, but Meadowes did not find it so, his
thoughts were amply occupied. When he
reached home he went in and sat down in a
chair beside the fire, apparently in a brown
study. What was he thinking about so intently
all the time? About a lie: for the
whole story of Sebastian Shepley’s marriage
had been invented by Richard Meadowes on
the spur of the moment, as he stood stammering
and hesitating before Anne Champion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meadowes had known Sebastian Shepley from
his childhood. They had been born and
brought up in the same little country village of
Wynford, where Meadowes’ father had owned
the Manor House and the wide lands appertaining
to it, while Shepley’s father was the village
apothecary. Then they both went to the
wars; Meadowes to fight, Shepley to heal;
now, tired of campaigning, which had never
been to his mind, Meadowes had left the service
and returned to England, where, since his
parents’ death, he had inherited, together with
the Manor House of Fairmeadowes, this house
in St. James’ Square and enough of money to
ruin most men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Richard Meadowes was neither idle nor
without interests. The whole of life appealed
vividly to him, every day was crowded with
incident and amusement, his difficulty was to
select between his pleasures: now of a sudden
he had brought himself into a curious place. It
had been from the easy pleasantness of his nature
that Meadowes had offered, when leaving
Flanders, to carry any letters home to Wynford
for Dr. Sebastian Shepley. The young surgeon
had hesitated for a moment before asking if,
instead of bearing a letter to Wynford, Meadowes
would deliver one in London.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘With all my heart—a dozen an’ you please,’
said Meadowes kindly; for he liked the young
man with his steady blue eyes, who came moreover
from Wynford like himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Sebastian Shepley had intrusted a bulky
letter to his care, and along with it a package
containing, said he, some amber beads for
‘Annie,’ ‘as yellow as her hair.’ These were
to be given to his sweetheart by Meadowes’
own hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, like most men who are good at making
pleasant promises, Meadowes was not quite so
good at keeping them. He forgot all about
Sebastian Shepley’s love-letter for several
weeks, and lost the amber beads, so that when
at last he set out to deliver the letter, he had
determined to make such apologies as he might
for the loss of the beads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when first his eyes rested on Anne Champion
he thought only of her beauty. He stood
and stammered before her, and then there
came a whisper: Shepley was in Flanders .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
might never return .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. might have forgotten
Anne when he did .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. why could he not supplant
him in the meantime?</p>

<p class='pindent'>No wonder he had hesitated for a little before
inventing the story; but now that it was
done a host of difficulties presented themselves
to Meadowes’ fancy. First of all, Shepley
might write again to Anne any day—in all
probability he would not do so for some weeks,
but still he might—therefore Anne must be induced
to leave her present home as quickly as
might be. Secondly, Anne had impressed him
as a self-respecting woman, quite able to take
care of herself; she was no silly child to be
easily deceived, and, so far as he could judge,
not to be bought either. It is true Anne had
taken the coin he offered her, but Meadowes
acknowledged that she had scarcely seemed to
know what she was about at the time. How
then was he to gain favour in her eyes? How
manage to ingratiate himself with her quickly
without rousing her suspicions? He had no
possible pretext for going to visit her again,
yet go he must, and that speedily, or he ran
the risk of Anne’s having received another letter
from her lover, which might make her disbelieve
all the statements she had accepted to-day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Meadowes weighed the matter in his
mind, he remembered Shepley’s amber beads.
Find them he must, and they might be offered
to Anne as a farewell gift from her faithless
adorer. So he prosecuted an active search for
the missing package, and when at last it had
been discovered, sat down and opened it. Then
Meadowes slipped the warm yellow beads
through his fingers like a monk at his devotions,
but all the while darting fears and shivers
of shame overcame him, for he was a man of
quick sensitiveness, fully conscious of the base
part he was playing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no time to be lost; the next day
at latest he must go to see Anne again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus it came about that Meadowes stood
once more at Anne Champion’s door the next
afternoon and knocked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anne opened it herself; she stood on the
threshold, and did not invite her visitor to
come in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Oh, ’tis you again,’ was all she said for
greeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I am come with the remainder of my message,
Anne,’ said Meadowes. ‘I forgot yesterday
to make over this part of it to you.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Come in then,’ said Anne, curtly enough,
and she moved across to the little window,
which stood open for the heat. The room had
a deserted air, Anne seemed to have been sitting
idle, for there were no signs of her usual
occupation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Sit down, sir,’ she said, and waited for
Meadowes to make known this further errand
of his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Shepley asked me to deliver this amber chain
into your hand as a keepsake, and to bear him
no ill will,’ he said, handing the necklace to
Anne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘A likely thing it is I’ll have his gifts!’
cried the girl. She flushed angrily, and with
a quick movement of her arm flung the chain
out at the window; it fell on the opposite roof,
and the smooth beads slid down the slates and
lodged in some unseen crevice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘There they may rot for me!’ she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Ah, come,’ began Meadowes; ‘he meant
kindly by the gift.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I’ll have none o’ his kindness then,’ said
Anne. She did not seem disposed for further
conversation. But Meadowes persisted:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You seem scarce so busy to-day.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘No more I am, sir; I be tired of work.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Have you ever lived in the country?’
queried Meadowes, who had since the day before
evolved his plans a little. ‘Work is none
so hard there, and living pleasant; quiet is
good for a sad heart.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You’ll have tried it, sir?’ said Anne sarcastically.
‘For sad hearts be mighty common.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Ah! I have had my sad days too.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I’d scarce have thought it, sir,’ said Anne,
taking a survey of her visitor. ‘But there,’
she added, as if on second thoughts, ‘you have
mayhap felt things like the rest of us.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I have—I have. God knows I feel things,’
said Meadowes, with sudden curious earnestness.
He crossed over to where Anne stood,
and laid his fine, white, ringed hand on her
arm for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I am grieved for you, Anne; indeed I am; I
had not thought ’twould be such a stroke to you,
this. I would it were in my power to help you.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anne shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘ ’Tis kind of you, sir, and thank you; there’s
but the cure of time for me, I do fear,’ she said,
drawing back slightly from the touch of Meadowes’
hand as she spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I have a cottage in the country,’ he began,
‘where an old nurse of mine keeps bees and
flowers and the like: mayhap a change to
country air would help you to the forgetting of
your trouble.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anne shook her head and smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I’d get no sale for my straw-plaits thereaway,’
she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Oh, I would pay you——’ began Meadowes,
but Anne cut him short.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘For what, sir?’ she asked sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meadowes became certain of what he had
only suspected before,—that Anne Champion
was quite able to take care of herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘For your work, my good girl,’ he said,
drawing himself up rather stiffly for a moment.
‘Martha hath over much on her hands between
the bees and the flowers. If you care to live
with her it would be to give her your assistance
in these matters.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I’ve no knowledge o’ flowers nor any skill
with bees, sir,’ said Anne, still speaking in a
suspicious tone. Then she added: ‘And where
will this place be, sir? for I have been no more
than ten miles from London all my days.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Not farther than that; ’tis out Richmond
way,’ said Meadowes. ‘But pray do not
hasten yourself to decide. I can get another
woman any day. ’Twas but that I fancied the
country might change your thoughts for you
that I made you the offer.’ He rose as he
spoke and held out his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Thank you, sir,’ said Anne, curtseying to
her fine visitor, and rather impressed by his
sudden assumption of dignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meadowes was quick to observe the advantage
he had gained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘If you care to take a week wherein to think
over the offer,’ he said, ‘I shall keep the place
vacant for you till then.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Thank you, sir,’ again said Anne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Shall I come and see you at the week’s
end?’ asked Meadowes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I thank you; yes, sir,’ said Anne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When her visitor had gone Anne sat down
by the window to consider the matter. ‘Him
an’ his bees!’ was her first contemptuous conclusion,
for, as she would have expressed it
herself, ‘handsome women they do know their
own know about the men.’ Then she thought
over the past, with its hard work and scanty
pay, over the present, that was swept empty
of hope and pleasure, into a future, that had
nothing to offer but work, work, work. It
was a fixed belief with Anne that men were
seldom wholly disinterested in their motives.
She could not bring herself to imagine that
Meadowes offered her this situation because he
wished his work done—no, no, it was because
she was ‘so rarely fine-looking,’ that was all.
But then what if it proved to be a good situation—good
pay, little work?—she would be a
fool to refuse it. And further, she was well
able to take care of herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are moods of mind when only some
change in the outward conditions of life can
promise hope or comfort. It seemed to Anne
impossible that she could stay on here in her
old surroundings when everything in the future
had changed for her. She was even weak and
feminine enough to imagine the delight of Mrs.
Nare when she discovered that her prophecies
had come true and Anne’s fine lover had proved
faithless. This thought recurred to her again
and again, for women are curious creatures,
and bad as they find it to be jilted, they perhaps
find it worse still that other women should
be able to marvel and gossip over their deserted
state! Said Anne, when this thought had become
intolerable, ‘I shall go away to the country;
Mrs. Nare shall be none the wiser,’ and
with that she decided to accept the offered situation,
whatever it might prove to be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So when on the following Sunday afternoon
Meadowes appeared once more at Yard’s Entry,
he found Anne quite ready to undertake
the unknown duties she had hesitated over the
week before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I’m happy to go, sir,’ she said; ‘and if so
be as I do fail at the work, ’tis your own fault,
sir, offering the place to one as knows nought
of country ways.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You will learn—you will learn,’ said Meadowes
hastily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘And your name, sir? if I may make bold
to ask.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Mr. Richard Sundon; I fancied I had given
you my name ere this.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘No, sir, and mayhap you live in the country
thereaway?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>It scarcely suited Meadowes to answer this
with absolute veracity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘No, in town—in rooms just now; some day
I shall settle down,’ he replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘O yes, sir, a home’s a fine thing they do
say,’ said Anne, in a dreary voice that had the
echo of tears in it.</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER III</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>Meadowes did not pay much heed to where he
was going as he left Yard’s Entry that Sunday
afternoon. He was so absorbed in his thoughts
that he walked forward without aim or direction.
And these thoughts were curiously involved:
a horror of what he was about; a determination
to persist in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘What’s this I am doing? what’s this I’ve
done? Broken a woman’s heart, and played a
good man false .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I am gaining (perhaps)
my desires, and losing (certainly) my
soul.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Soul? Have we got souls? I
that am doing this, have I a soul? I doubt
it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we are but as the beasts that perish—and
yet——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stumbled along through the narrow,
crowded streets. ‘I’ll go and pray,’ he said,
stopping suddenly before the door of one of the
old city churches (it stands there yet, grey and
cool).</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Here,’ he said to the verger, ‘is the church
empty?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Empty as a new-made grave, sir,’ said the
man cheerfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meadowes passed into the musty coolness of
the church. He walked up the aisle and chose
out the darkest corner he could find, where to
offer up his strange petitions. There was a
brass let into the wall here commemorating the
brave fall of men who had died gallant deaths;
a banner, bullet-singed and tattered, hung from
the roof. Meadowes knelt under the faded
fringes and covered his eyes with his hands, to
shut out the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the former doubt invaded him, and the
terror that the unseen was a delusion and man
but a soulless higher brute with a hand-breadth
of Time to sport in, overcame him with the
blackness of despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Better far have a lost soul than none at all,’
he cried out in horror. He looked up at the
banner above him; for things, after all, as intangible
as the soul he doubted of, some happy
mortals had bled and died—for Honour, Patriotism,
Courage. Had they forfeited the merry
years for shadows, been fools for their pains?
Remembrances crowded on him of War and
Death: he seemed to see whole spectral armies
of the slain arise. He named them happy as
they rose; for had they not died undoubtingly,
bartering life for these intangible realities so
worthy the life-blood of men! Ah for the unquestioning
heart—to be able to walk straight
forward in a plain path! But for him question
would rise upon question: and this, the darkest
doubt, the poisoning of Effort at its very
sources, was worst of all—no Unseen, nothing
but the solid merry world really to be counted
upon! If this was so, then good-bye to aspiration,
grasp at the Seen, hold it fast, for seventy
miserable years only were to be depended on—depended
on! not seventy seconds were assured
to him. ‘Lord! I must have my pleasures!’
he cried, remembering the few and
evil years. Then in spite of the doubts that
tormented him, Meadowes suddenly began to
pray. He came before the God whose existence
he could not be sure of, with a confession
he would not have made to his fellow-men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘O God,’ he prayed, speaking low into his
clasped hands, ‘I have planned this thing and
am going on with it—’tis pure devilry, but I
am going on. Lord, I do it open-eyed. Some
day punish me as I deserve—now I must take
my pleasure——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>A curious prayer; but perhaps better than
no prayer at all. For herein lies the world’s
hope, that every man—the blackest sinner
amongst us—is on his own extraordinary terms
with the Unseen. Were we as grossly material
as appears, we were lost indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meadowes’ faith truly was reduced to the
minimum, and yet, and yet—to Something he
made confession, assured only of this, that if
any Presence listened it must be with pity.
He rose from his knees and went out again into
the crowded streets, filled not with any sudden
resolutions of repentance, but with the determination
to persist in the course he had originally
planned out. He even felt a certain relief
of conscience. ‘<span class='it'>I have explained it with
God</span>,’ he found himself saying, adding a moment
later, ‘If there be such an One.’ Then
his thoughts seemed to fall into question and
answer:</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘And doth that make all straight?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘<span class='it'>Straighter: for I have said that such punishment
as I deserve for this, I shall take.</span>’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Did you mean what you prayed?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘<span class='it'>If there are punishments in truth.</span>’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Do you think there are?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘<span class='it'>No: I doubt it.</span>’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Then you will have your pleasure without
risk?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘<span class='it'>I hope for it.</span>’</p>

<p class='pindent'>But conscience had after all the last word,
for it spoke suddenly and loudly then:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘<span class='it'>No, no; “a sword shall pierce thine own
heart also.”</span>’</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER IV</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>Till a few years ago the cottage was still standing
where Anne Champion went to live at the
bounty of Richard Meadowes. It stood on one
of the crossways leading off the great west
London road; but few people passed down the
green lane, few even looked that way. The
cottage was one of those deep thatched old
dwellings that look like an owl with its feathers
drawn up over its head; it had a garden filled
with flowers and bee-hives, and the straight
walk leading up to the door was bordered with
flowering shrubs. Anne worked in the garden,
clumsily enough at first, and she looked after
the bees and got stung frequently, and time
went on. Each week the old woman, Martha
Hare, who occupied the house along with her,
received a certain sum of money to be divided
between herself and Anne; but Meadowes only
came occasionally to the cottage at first: he
was very cautious, having weighed Anne’s
character pretty accurately. Then his visits
became more frequent, and were somewhat
prolonged, then he brought Anne a present
from town. Anne began to draw her usual
conclusions from these things: ‘He’s a-making
up to me,’ she said to Martha Hare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she was scarcely prepared for it when
Meadowes suddenly asked her one day if she
would marry him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I have been thinking of it for long, Anne,’
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Sir, sir!’ said vulgar Anne. ‘I’m not
your kind.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘But that is just my difficulty, and if you
will listen to me I shall explain it. You cannot
but see, Anne, that you are scarce in my class,
as you say, and for that reason ’twill be better
to keep the matter private, else my father will
cut me off with a shilling. But if you will
marry me privately, Anne, I swear to you I’ll
be a good husband to you.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anne had been listening intently; but here
she suddenly held up her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘There,’ she cried, ‘I’ll have you with no
promises if I have you at all. I’ll take you as
I know you, sir, and trust you but so far as I
sees you.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘But you will trust me, Anne?’ he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘No. I’ll never trust no man again this
side time. But I’ll come an’ live along of you,
sir, if so be I’m done with work and care for
ever.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Anne, Anne, do not be so bitter,’ said
Meadowes. Anne stood looking at him silently
for a moment, then she laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘ ’Tis like I’m marrying you for love, sir?’
she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Well, I have done what I could for you,’
said Meadowes (but he blushed hotly as he
spoke. ‘<span class='it'>I am a devil</span>,’ he said to himself).</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You have, sir, one way, but now you’ve
showed your hand, so to say. I knew as it
would be this way some day—I’ve had lovers
an’ lovers by the score. Not but that you’ve
been civil and taken your time, sir. Well, as
I do say, sir, you be kind and I’ll take you for
that. But ’tis not for love, sir. I have no
heart left in me now, but a stone where it once
was. A woman she do have two throws o’ the
dice in her life—one’s love an’ t’other’s money.
Lose the first; you’d best, if you’re a wise
woman, have a try for the second, for with
never the one nor t’other you be in a sad
case.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meadowes listened gravely to this, Anne’s
gospel of prudence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Well,’ he said at length, ‘that’s your way
of thinking, Anne, and mayhap mine is not so
different—to take what I can get.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘What are you gettin’, sir?’ asked Anne,
turning suddenly to him. ‘Lor’ sakes, sir!
what hath gone agin you in life that you take
second best so soon?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Second best?’ queried Meadowes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Ay, second best. You’ll not make me believe
as how you are wedding for love, sir.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I—I am very fond of you,’ Meadowes began,
but Anne stopped him impatiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Not you, sir. I’m rarely fine-looking, an’
men be terrible fools. You’ve a mind to
marry—that’s short and long for it,—but for
love——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>The silence that Anne ended her sentence
with was more expressive than words. Then
she turned and laid her hand in his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Here, sir,’ she said, ‘I’ll ask no questions.
Mayhap you’ve had your story like myself.
Leastways you’ve been kind to me, and I’ll
be a good wife to you if you’re wishful to
marry with me. Like enough some day we
may both forget——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned hastily away with a sob that
would not be kept back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Shall we say Friday of next week, then,
Anne?’ said Meadowes, passing his arm round
her and patting her shoulder very kindly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘When you please, sir.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘And we shall be married here, not in church,
for the reason I have mentioned?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Any place you please, sir.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘My friend Mr. Prior will marry us.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Any parson you have a mind for, sir.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meadowes drew Anne closer to him, and
kissed her lovely tear-stained face. Then he
bade her good-bye, and she went into the cottage
and sat there face to face with life, as every
woman is when she makes up her mind on what
now-a-days we term the Marriage Problem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anne was very clear-sighted; she saw, as
every woman with her wits about her must see,
that it is not good for woman—especially pretty
woman—to be alone. She saw in ‘Dick Sundon,’
as she called him, a protector whom she
had every reason to like. In the bitterness of
her heart she had vowed never to trust any
man again, but she must have had some vague
feeling of confidence in this kindly bright-eyed
suitor, else Anne would have hesitated more
than she did before coming to her decision.
She had hitherto been rather suspicious of the
attentions of ‘fine gentlemen,’ as she termed
them, but this offer of marriage seemed honourable
to a degree. ‘I’ll never forget Sebastian—not
for all he hath done by me—but mayhap
I’d be happier wedded to Dick Sundon
than living alone all my days. Oh, he’s kind
enough for certain, an’ free with his money,
and now he do wish to marry me what better
can I do?’ she asked herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unanswerable arguments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meadowes, on his part, went home profoundly
miserable. For the sinner who would sin enjoyably
must be of another stuff from that of
which this man was made. Just as he had
achieved success, his heart turned with a perfectly
genuine emotion of pity towards the
woman he had deceived so cruelly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet on he went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening he called upon his friend Mr.
Simon Prior, at his rooms in Piccadilly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘A somewhat late visitor, I fear, Prior,’ he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Never too late to be welcome,’ said Prior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Well, I am come on business, which must be
my excuse,’ said Meadowes. He sat down, and
Prior waited to hear what the business might be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘The fact is, I wish you to do me a favour,—I
wish your assistance to the carrying out of—of
an affair of some delicacy.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I shall be delighted; but I find it difficult
to imagine .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my money affairs,’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. began
Prior, whose one idea of a difficulty was
money.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I had best make a long story short,’ said
Meadowes, ‘I want you to act cleric for me;
I’ve seen your powers of mimicry ere this, and
I swear you’d play the parson to a nicety.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Phew!’ whistled Prior. ‘So ’tis a woman
is the difficulty; but why, Meadowes, if I may
intrude upon your secrets, why do you demand
a parson?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Ah! there is my difficulty. There are
women, you see, who value their good name,
and this woman is of the number. ’Tis unfortunate,
but a fact I cannot get over. She hath
promised to be my wife, however, and I have
explained to her that family reasons make a
private marriage necessary at present. I trusted
to you for the rest of it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Simon Prior leant back in his chair and eyed
his visitor narrowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘And what are you going to give to me in
return for these valuable services?’ he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meadowes leant forward—his bright eyes
blazed in the lamplight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I’ll pay every debt you have, if that will
do,’ he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Prior went through a quick mental sum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Yes, that will do,’ he said, when it had
been added up. ‘I have played many a part,
and have no doubt I could acquit myself with
credit in this. I’ll go to church and hear the
parson’s drawl (I’ve not heard it this many a
year), and I’ll reproduce it for you whenever
you please with becoming gravity.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Thanks! I’ve no manner of doubt you
will. Then you will tell me what I owe you?
And, by the way, this matter must never cross
your lips, Prior; I may trust you for that?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You may.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Then on Saturday of next week, all being
well?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘On Saturday of next week, all being well,’
repeated Prior, in such a startling reproduction
of Meadowes’ voice that both men laughed
aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But laughter was not in Meadowes’ heart
though it was on his lips. He rose to say
good-night soon after, and Simon Prior lay
back in his arm-chair and smiled.</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER V</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps it was because he felt the knot so
obligingly tied by Simon Prior not quite impossible
to untie, that Richard Meadowes took
his marital obligations very lightly. He was
well pleased with his new acquisition, and used
to ride out from town constantly to see Anne.
They would walk out together in the long
spring twilights, and gradually Anne began to
lose her dread of such a fine lover and spoke to
him freely and naturally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anne could be a very amusing companion;
for she had quick wits; and that for companionship
is far better than being well educated.
She would tell Meadowes all about her life;
excepting one episode only, no mention of
which ever crossed her lips—of the men who
had courted her, and the women who had hated
her, of the straits of poverty, and all she had
seen and suffered and enjoyed in her five-and-twenty
years’ pilgrimage. In return, she
would ask Meadowes about the unknown world
to which he belonged. Had they always
enough to eat without thinking about it or
working for it? (‘Lord sakes, how grand!’)
Had they never to walk when they were weary,
or toil when they were faint? Was it possible
he had never known what it was to be cold for
want of clothing, or run out of fuel in the winter?
(‘You scarce know you’re alive!’) Or,
sorest strait of all, was it possible he had never
known sickness and want together? (‘You’ve
not felt the Lord’s hand on you yet then,
Dick.’) And she would listen with delight to
Meadowes’ tales of his world. Outwardly, indeed,
Anne was cheerful enough now; Meadowes
began to think she was forgetting the
past. Only her entire silence about Sebastian
Shepley seemed to mark any feeling on the
subject. Yet every now and then he fancied
she was thinking of her former lover. Once as
they walked together down the lane on a lovely
summer night—the birds were singing as if
their little throats would burst, the year’s
jubilee was at its height—Meadowes turned to
her in his sudden, impulsive way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘ ’Tis fine to be alive and young,’ he said;
‘and the birds sing like the angels of Paradise!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I think to have heard the sparrows in the
Green Park——’ Anne began to say, almost as
if she were speaking to herself—then she broke
off in the middle of her sentence and turned
away. A moment later she added—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You do speak rarely clear, Dick—for all the
world like a flute’s note. I like to hearken to
your voice better than them birds by far.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meadowes was charmed with this pretty
speech; he flung his arm round Anne’s waist
and kissed her. She looked up at him with
her brown eyes full of tears; but they may
have been tears of mirth, for all she said was,
‘Good sakes! but men be mortal vain,’ and
with that she drew herself away from his embrace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Why should she cry over the sparrows in
the Green Park?’ Meadowes wondered; how
should he know how often Anne had walked
there with Sebastian Shepley?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Time wore on, summer merged into autumn,
and still Anne had never spoken once to Meadowes
about Sebastian Shepley; they were the
best of friends, Anne welcomed his coming and
mourned at his going, but without a trace of
sentiment, as Meadowes found himself forced
to admit. Men do not like a want of sentiment
in women: they may condone it in their own
sex, it is considered an essential in ours; so
Meadowes, who had never blamed himself for
lacking this quality, found it in his heart to be
surprised and a little indignant with Anne for
doing so. ‘She should be beginning to care
more for me by now,’ he thought; he had
been a very devoted husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was devotion indeed, which urged him to
ride out from London one cruel night of wind
and rain. The miles seemed as though they
would never be got over; yet Meadowes rode
on and on, out into the deep country, his head
bowed before the lashing of the rain and the
onslaught of the wind. At the Cross Roads
Inn he dismounted, and leaving his horse there,
strode on through the darkness to Anne’s cottage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Good sakes, Dick, is it you!’ cried Anne
at sound of his knock. She flung open the
door and he passed in, into the warmth and
stillness of the cottage kitchen, where he stood
laughing and breathless, the water dripping
from his drenched clothes on to the sanded
floor. Anne, exclamatory and sympathetic,
stood beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘ ’Tis wetted through and through you are,
Dick,’ she said, wringing the flap of his riding-coat.
‘For the love of heaven go and cast
these wet clothes from off you, while I do heat up
some ale for you on the fire. There be naught
like hot ale for chills. Good lack! to think of
mortal man riding from London this night!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meadowes laughed. ‘I shall be none the
worse, Anne. But not hot ale—mulled claret
for me, my girl.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I have no knowledge of your fine sour-wine
drinks, Dick. For certain the hot ale be far
wholesomer,’ urged Anne, who clung to tradition
as surely as Meadowes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So to please her hot ale he drank, sitting by
the wide cottage fireplace listening to the driving
storm. The candle, which had been low in
its socket, burned lower; then Anne put it out,
and still they sat silently in the pleasant fire-lit
room and heard the storm rave on outside.
They were sitting side by side on the settle by
the fire, Meadowes had his arm round Anne’s
shoulder in his kindly caressing fashion, but
though Anne permitted the endearment she
did not respond to it in any way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You are very quiet to-night?’ said Meadowes
at last. Anne shivered, and bent forward
to stir up the fire for answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘What ails you, Anne? Has aught distressed
you through the day?’ he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anne turned round and looked at him; her
eyes had a curiously wild, frightened expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘ ’Tis like great guns,’ she said. ‘There,
there. O Lord, I can’t a-bear to hear it—guns
and guns a-thundering on, and when it cometh
round the corner o’ the house ’tis for all the
world like the shrieks of dying men.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meadowes was mystified by her words. He
had never seen Anne fanciful before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Well, what of it?—’tis not unlike heavy
firing, as you say,’ he admitted. ‘But you
are safe enough here, my girl, in all truth.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Eh, Dick! don’t <span class='it'>you</span> understand?’ cried
Anne. ‘Battles, and guns, and all.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
do seem to hear from over seas, from Flanders,
bringing to my mind all I’ve a mind to forget.
I’ve sat all this day a-hearing of them guns,
and times I’d stop my ears.—O Lord! there
be the screams again.’ And Anne, turning to
the only helper she had, held out her hands to
him with a trembling, childish gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Dick, Dick,’ she said, ‘you be quick to feel
all things, and kind too, more nor I deserve, I
that have married you, and my heart turning
back to another.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quick to feel, Meadowes was feeling a hundred
conflicting sensations at that moment.
But first of all he must quiet Anne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Come, Anne,’ he said, ‘you are tired and
fanciful. ’Tis time you were gone to bed, and
by the morning you will have forgot the storm
that scares you now. Ah, I understand altogether,
Anne; aye, and feel for you too. But
these things are better left alone, it but makes
them harder to speak of them.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Maybe, maybe,’ said Anne, rising to put a
fresh candle in the candlestick. She had appealed
to ‘Dick’ in vain, she thought, and
would not attempt to make him understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I have some letters to write,’ said Meadowes,
dismissing the subject; ‘I shall sit up
and finish them.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Anne had gone, however, there, was
not much letter-writing done. Meadowes sat
and looked into the fire, coming to several conclusions.
Well, here was the end of his amour;
up to this time he had been quite content with
Anne, delighted with her; but now—he simply
could not stand this. If she was going to be
always thinking about Sebastian Shepley, and
even mentioning him, it was high time that the
connection between himself and her was at an
end. Meadowes, who was a very fastidious
man, shuddered at the whole situation. ‘Horrible;
truly ’twas in Providence I did not
marry her,’ he said. Yet he had quite enough
of conscience to make it a difficult matter for
him to break with Anne. He dreaded beyond
measure her anger when she found herself to
have been so duped. It was indeed almost impossible
to contemplate telling her. How
would it best be done? Offer her money?
Anne would never consider that a recompense.
Just leave her? ‘Even I am not bad enough
for that!’ Trust to time? Time would possibly
make matters worse. Yet after hours of
thought on the subject this last and very lame
conclusion was the one which Meadowes finally
adopted. He resolved not to see so much of
her now and—to wait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘A plague upon Sebastian Shepley, and a
plague upon Constancy and Love and all the
Virtues!’ he said as he rose from his chair at
last; ‘and equally a plague upon Richard
Meadowes, and Treachery and Passion and all
the Vices,’ he added, as he stood looking down
at the last embers of the wood-fire that glowed
on the hearth. He gave an angry kick to the
red ashes with the toe of his riding-boot that
sent a shower of scarlet sparks up into the air;
they fell down a moment later in soft grey ash,
and the fire was out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘The end of all hot fires,’ said Meadowes, as
he groped his way across to the door.</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER VI</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>‘Business,’ Meadowes explained to Anne a few
days after this, ‘was taking him out of London.’
His absence, too, might be somewhat
prolonged. He left ample means with his
friend Mr. Prior (‘the parson who wedded us,
Anne’), and these moneys were to be forwarded
by him to Anne at regular intervals; she
would want for nothing. Anne took the news
quietly, as was her way, and hoped his business
might delay ‘Dick’ a shorter time than he
anticipated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meadowes, however, knew his own mind
now, and was quite decided as to the length of
time he would be absent from Anne. In the
spring a child would be born to them, and after
that he would come and tell her everything;
till then it might be brutal to disturb her present
peace of mind. But after the event it must
be done, and the sooner the better. This had
been his ultimate decision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still, decisions being more easily taken than
put into execution, Anne had been a very proud
and happy mother for some eight weeks before
Meadowes found it possible to speak to her of
the matter of their supposed marriage. And
even then his hand was, so to speak, forced.
He had ridden out from town in haste one summer
morning, and now sat in the porch with
Anne, wondering why after all he had come,
for tell her he could not, though he had started
with the determination to do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘For certain, Dick, you be mighty silent,’
said Anne at last, looking up from her sewing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I am annoyed over business,’ said Meadowes
lamely, looking down at the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘And a fine packet of letters unopened in
your pocket too,’ laughed Anne, pointing with
her needle at the bundle as she spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I rode off in such haste,’ began Meadowes
absently, then he took the letters from his
pocket and turned them over one by one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘From my lawyer—from Simon Prior—from——’
He stopped short and looked hard
at the third letter, shook his head, and broke
the seal to glance at its contents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Lor’, Dick! what hath come to you?’
cried Anne, throwing aside her work a moment
later, for she had caught sight of his face; it
was grown suddenly grey and rigid. She
stepped behind him, laying her hand on his
shoulder, and glanced down at the sheet of
paper he held.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Nothing, Anne—a mere joke,’ said Meadowes
quickly, crumpling up the paper as if
Anne could have read what was written on it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Dick, that’s a word from Sebastian Shepley,
so sure as I do stand here,’ said Anne, her
voice shaking; ‘I do know the looks of his
name upon the sheet, for ’twas all ever I could
read for myself of his letters, an’ many’s the
one I had.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Shepley? what would Shepley write to me
of?’ asked Meadowes hotly, rising and walking
away down the garden-walk towards the
gate. But Anne would not be put off. She
followed him down the walk and laid her hand
on his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Tell me, Dick,’ she said; ‘I had a deal
rather hear straight all he hath to say.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I swear to you——’ Meadowes began; but
Anne interrupted him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Then you swear false, Dick: ’tis writ by
Sebastian’s own hand, or my name be not Anne
Sundon. Best tell me what he saith.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘The letter is from a man Steven Shackleton,
Anne. You mistook the lettering, being no
scholar,’ persisted Meadowes, lying desperately
now, his courage had so withered when brought
to the point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anne faced round upon him; her big clever
brown eyes seemed to be reading into his very
soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You’re makin’ up tales, Dick,’ she said.
‘You won’t look me in the eyes and tell me
that’s not Sebastian’s hand of write.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘There,’ cried Meadowes, facing round to
meet her eyes directly. ‘The letter was
from——’ His glance fell to the ground, as
he added, ‘Steven Shackleton’ again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘If so be you speak straight——’ Anne began.
But Meadowes with an impatient exclamation
cut her short.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘What do you take me for? Well, I must
be off. A fool I was to leave town without
reading my letters, for back to it I must go in
a couple of hurries. Come, bid me good-bye,
Anne,’ he added, bending down towards her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Good-bye,’ said Anne absently, turning
away into the cottage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat beside the baby’s cradle, rocking it
slowly, and gazed down at the floor. What
did all this confusion and contradiction on
Dick’s part mean? Why did he look like
that, as scared as though he had seen a ghost?
And why was he so angry, and why again so
flushed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick meantime was riding back to London
at a great pace—riding as if the devil himself
rode behind him. But when he reached town
it was to ask himself why he had come there;
for deep down in his heart he knew that the
time had come, and that tell Anne he must—yes,
the whole black truth from first to last.
He had ridden away from her searching truth-compelling
eyes, but they followed him still,
and back he must go and have done with it all.
Why would the earth not open and swallow
him up?—Ah, happy Dathan and Abiram!</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER VII</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>The day passed slowly for Anne after Dick had
left. Her mind was troubled by vague half-formulated
doubts. Had Dick spoken truly,
or had he lied to save her pain? Surely, surely
she could never mistake Sebastian’s signature,
the same she had gazed at so often, and kissed,
aye, and wept over also. She revolved these
questions in her mind all day and found no satisfactory
answers to them; when she lay down
at night, one insistent suggestion whispered on
in her ear, ‘Why did Dick look like that?
Was he lying? Did ever man look so mazed
and scared when he spoke the truth?’ Then
Anne’s tired eyes closed and she entered the
beautiful dream-world. Now the dream-world
holds sensations of indescribable vividness not
attainable on the earth-world; here experiences
come within the scope of words, there we experience
the inexpressible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a dream, then, in a vision of the night,
when deep sleep had fallen upon her, Anne
dreamed and thought she awoke in Paradise.
For Sebastian came to her (out of nowhere,
after the fashion of dreams), and their souls
seemed fused together in a warm silence. Not
a word was spoken between them; yet the
miserable past was blotted out for ever; a great
light shone everywhere—a glow, a heat of forgiveness,
a passion of fulfilment at last; and
the beautiful thrilling silence of it all! They
seemed alone in hollow space, out of reach of
this world’s hubbub. What need of explanations
when all was understood? Her thoughts
rested on that splendid wordless vacancy.
‘Sure I be in heaven at last!’ said poor Anne.
‘A fine heaven too, that quiet as it is! The
old one as I used to hear on was all noise o’
trumpets an’ hosannas—here’s heaven indeed,
with this grand quiet as is to go on for
ever.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anne woke suddenly then—the appalling
conviction of a dream was upon her: she might
have spoken face to face with her dear lover,
so vividly present he had seemed, such a sudden
assurance of his faithfulness had come to
her. She sat up in bed and called out aloud in
the quiet room—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Lord! be it a dream? Sebastian dear,
what’s this I’m feelin’? Have Dick Sundon
fooled me out an’ out a-tellin’ lies of you all
this long time? Help me, am I losing my
judgment?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose up, groped her way across the dark
room, and drew back the window-curtain.
The first streaks of day were showing in the
sky, the peaceful wooded land was half shrouded
still in the mists of morning. With long
whistling notes the birds gave welcome to the
coming day; they called to each other, near at
hand, and far off among the blossoming thickets,
like happy spirits that sing together in the
fields of joy. Anne leaned from the window
and listened to these songs that went up so
straight into the dim blue morning skies. A
great fear held her fast,—the fear that Dick,
her husband, her helper, had deceived her.
In her dismay and bewilderment she could only
repeat again and again, ‘Lord help me, Lord
help me,’ scarcely knowing what she said.
Then, afraid to lie down again, she dressed and
went down-stairs and into the garden. Far off
on the London road she heard the distant trotting
of a horse and the roll of wheels; some
one must be driving along in the quiet morning
dimness. Anne stepped down the little walk
and stood leaning against the gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wheels came nearer, and then came
down the lane. Anne turned away, for even
in that dim light the passers-by must see her
tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she heard the chaise stop at the gate;
Dick’s voice—how clear it sounded in the early
stillness!—was speaking to the post-boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘There, my man; that’s for your trouble all
a dark night.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Thank you, sir—thanks to you,’ said the
boy as the chaise rattled off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anne turned and came down the little walk
to meet Dick; her gown brushed the dew from
the overgrown rose-bushes in showers as she
passed. She came towards him silently, her
face tear-stained, tragic. Dick held out both
hands to her, but before he could speak Anne
checked him with an upraised hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘God’s spoke to me, Dick,’ she said, stopping
before him like an avenging angel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I have come to tell you everything,’ said
poor Dick; and at that moment he drank the
dregs of a bitter cup, ‘for I knew you guessed
something when I left you.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘God spoke to me in a dream,’ repeated
Anne. ‘When I waked up I knew for sure
you had lied to me.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Yes, Anne, I lied,’ he said, almost in a
whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘About Sebastian?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Yes.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘An’ he never played me false, nor married
a Dutch wife?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Never.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Come,’ said Anne. ‘Come then an’ try if
you can speak truth this once.’ She pointed to
the seat by the bee-hives, and in silence they
crossed over to it and sat down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Tell me now,’ said Anne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick leant forward and began his story, and
a pitiful story it was. Now that he was face
to face with the worst he made no attempt at
extenuation of his falsity; he might have been
reading off the words from a printed page, they
came so straight from his lips, his flute-clear
voice never hesitated once till the whole
was told. Anne on her part listened quietly
enough; without the usual exclamatory interruptions
which her sex commonly indulge in.
When the story was done there was a moment’s
silence, before she said, speaking very
low—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Eh! but I’ve been a bitter fool.’ She rose
then and stood looking down at Dick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I’m goin’ now,’ she said. ‘If I’m no
man’s wife, at least I’ll be no man’s mistress.
An’ for the child, you’d best care for him
yourself. You’ll maybe make him as good a
man as his father some day.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick sprang up and caught her hand.
‘Anne, Anne,’ he cried, ‘you must see how it
is—you must understand—I scarce knew all
your feeling for Shepley at first—I thought
you had forgot—I thought women forgot always—I
had not realised—not until that night
you spoke of him—and then, then I could not
bear it, and I resolved to tell you truly. I——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Oh, you’ve acted mighty true for certain,’
said Anne quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I have indeed told you all the truth——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Yes, now.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘But, Anne, men are mortal—will fall before
temptation. ’Tis hard to blame us too cruelly.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘O yes; for certain men be mortal.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I shall in truth provide for you all your
days, Anne; I thought of no other thing.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Will you, sir?’ said Anne, with a curious
smile, and Meadowes, not catching its meaning,
pursued eagerly—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘All your days truly, Anne; you shall have
all that woman can wish, if you will but pardon
me.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anne stood looking at him in a curious dispassionate
way for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I’d sooner starve,’ she said then, shortly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘But, Anne, you can never suppose that I
would let you want, after all there has come
and gone between us, after——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anne smiled again her curious smile, and
shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘A strange man you be for certain, Dick,’
she said; ‘kind an’ tender when you’ve a
mind to be, and one as feels quick. She paused
before adding slowly, ‘<span class='it'>And just as false as hell</span>.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meadowes winced under the words, but he
went on, ‘False or no, Anne, I must provide
for you—for you and the child.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘For the child mayhap, never for me,’ said
Anne. ‘You’d best see after him, for he’ll
be set down to your account when all things is
squared. See you train him up to be so good a
man as you are, Dick.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Then do you not wish to care for your son
yourself, Anne?’ asked Meadowes incredulously,
for, up to this time, Anne had doted on
the boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘No more I do. He be your son, Dick, and
’tis for you to fend for him.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Then——’ Meadowes hesitated, waiting
for Anne to make her intentions known.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I’ve worked before, and now I’ll work
again; and if so be I get no work, then I’ll
starve, as I’ve starved before,’ said Anne
quietly. ‘Martha’s kind and up in years, best
leave the boy with her.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Are you going to leave him?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Yes, an’ never see him nor you again,’ said
Anne. She turned away into the house without
another word, and Meadowes heard her go
up-stairs and move about in her room gathering
a few possessions together. She came out
again before long, carrying a little bundle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Good-bye, Dick,’ she said, holding out her
hand to him; ‘good-bye to the part on you as
was kind to me—the rest be rotten bad.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘It cannot be you are really going, Anne.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Good-bye,’ said Anne for answer, and she
walked away down the lane and turned off at
the opening that led into the London road.</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>On a warm summer evening, some three weeks
later, Richard Meadowes sat in the library of
his town house thinking, perhaps not unnaturally,
of Anne Champion and wondering where
she was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Dr. Sebastian Shepley, to wait upon you,
sir,’ said the man-servant, showing some one
in, and Meadowes rose to greet his visitor, feeling
the room strangely warm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Ah, Shepley,’ was all he said for welcome
to the tall steady-eyed man who came forward
into the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shepley sat down opposite to Richard Meadowes
and facing the sunlight. His pleasant
blue eyes rested on Meadowes inquiringly for a
moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I fear I have intruded on you, sir,’ he said,
noticing the other man’s embarrassment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I—I am pleased to see you,’ said Meadowes,
not with absolute veracity. The situation
seemed at that moment intolerable to him—better,
he thought, make a quick end of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You have heard about Anne Champion?’
he said, forcing himself to look straight at
Sebastian Shepley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I am come for no other reason than to ask
your aid in the matter,’ said Shepley, ‘for the
last I have heard of Anne was the message of
thanks you gave me from her anent the amber
necklace. Often as I’ve writ to her I have
heard never a word in answer. Tell me, sir,
do you know aught of where she went?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I know naught of Anne now,’ said Meadowes,
looking down as he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘<span class='it'>Now?</span>’ asked Shepley, for something in
the other’s voice attracted his attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘A year and more she lived with me, and
she bore me a son,’ said Meadowes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a moment of silence that seemed
to tingle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘There—swallow your lies!’ cried Shepley;
and he struck with all his great strength across
Meadowes’ lips. Without another word he
left the room, passed out through the hall, and
strode away down the Square.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Lies, lies—hellish black lies every word he
spoke,’ he cried in his heart. ‘And ah! my
poor Annie, what is come to you these weary
years?’ Then remembering that Anne’s
neighbours in Yard’s Entry might have some
knowledge of her whereabouts he turned his
steps in that direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was drawing to sundown when at last he
reached Yard’s Entry. He stood still for a
moment and looked up at the little window he
had known as Anne’s, and which used to reflect
the sunlight. It was blazing scarlet just now.
Then he went up to the doorway and knocked;
Mrs. Nare appeared in answer to his summons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘A good even to you, mistress,’ said Shepley.
‘And can you tell me aught of Anne
Champion, who lived here some two years
since?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Nare squinted up at him out of her narrow
old eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Anne, she came back here some three weeks
agone,’ she said. ‘Came and went her ways
again. And now she hath come here mortal
stricken—taken with a fever she’ve caught
working amidst the rags for a Jew man in
Flower and Dean Street.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sebastian waited to hear no more; he ran
up the dark stair and unceremoniously opened
the door of Anne’s room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such a blaze of light smote across his eyes as
he came in that he was half-blinded, for the
skies were scarlet that night from a great sunset,
and all the room was lit up with the red
glow. He stood for a moment in the doorway
shading his eyes from the dazzle, then stepped
across the crazy old floor, that creaked and
gave under his heavy tread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Annie, Annie!’ he cried, kneeling down
beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Anne, she thought she dreamed again;
the weary tossings of the desolate day were
done—she tasted a supreme felicity. What if
with the breaking day the vision fled, and she
woke again to want and loneliness? enough
that now it tarried with her. She would not
move, she scarcely dared to breathe for dread
lest the dream should depart; but lay very
still and felt the kindly strength of Sebastian’s
arm support her, and his cool hard cheek
pressed against hers that burned with fever.
‘Annie,’ he said again, and this time Anne
opened her eyes and smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Eh, Sebastian, Sebastian, my dear man,
stay—stay one minute, for dreams be terrible
short,’ she cried. Nor would all Shepley’s
words reassure her of his actual presence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘So many days as I’ve lain here, an’ such
dreams and dreams! Lor’! them was dreams!
You and Dick Sundon, Dick Sundon an’ you,
back and fore you came and went the two of
you. Sometimes Phil ’ud be there too (Phil
my boy as is)—(Lord Christ, have a care on
Phil, being that he’s so young and with none
but Dick Sundon a-carin’ of him!) .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. then
I’d dream of Dick for hours and hours, an’ now,
Sebastian, ’tis you; Lord send this dream stays!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shepley knelt beside her, listening to all her
strange babble of ‘Dick’ and ‘Phil;’ but
feeling how the fever ran hot in her blood he
pushed back the fears that came to him with
her words. He looked round the room, with
the stamp of relentless poverty set everywhere
on it, and thanked Heaven he was there now.
For poor Anne lay on the bare boards of this
place that was now her shelter, and for covering
she had thrown over her the dress she had
taken off. No trace of meat or drink was to
be seen anywhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he sat thus taking in the bareness of poor
Anne’s sick-room, with a perfunctory little
knock the door was shoved open and Mistress
Nare came in. She walked across the floor on
tiptoe and stood looking at Anne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘The fever hath gotten that hold on her
blood ’twill burn her up before the week is
out,’ she said sagely, winking across at Sebastian.
‘And by your leave, sir, I’d make bold
to say you’d best sit farther off from her—’tis
a catching sickness I dare swear.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I am come here to cure her,’ said Sebastian;
‘I am a surgeon to my trade.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘For certain then, sir, you’ve come too late,’
croaked the old woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sebastian rose angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Have a care what you say,’ he exclaimed.
‘And now, if you’ll do me a service, you shall
go and buy all that Anne Champion needs—a
bed to lie on——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘And die on,’ interpolated Mrs. Nare viciously,
but Sebastian gave no heed to her
remark, only went on with his enumeration:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘And blankets to cover her, and food to eat
and wine to drink—all these things she must
have before the day is done; so hasten you—if
so be you wish for this.’ He drew from his
pocket a coin and laid it in the old woman’s
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘A bed and blankets. Food and wine and
fire,’ repeated Mistress Nare. ‘Good lack,
sir, dyin’ Anne she’ve not got so much as will
buy a shroud to wrap her in!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Here,’ said Sebastian hastily, shaking out
from his purse a handful of coins. ‘How
much will you require?’ Mrs. Nare was convinced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Happen three guineas, sir, to begin with,’
she said, and her crooked old fingers closed
greedily over the yellow coins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Well, hasten—hasten,’ said Sebastian, and
Mrs. Nare shuffled off down the stair chuckling
and curious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Dyin’ Annie’s gotten a lover up to the last,
Matthew,’ she said as she passed her son on the
stair. So much for maternal jealousy.</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER IX</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>The vision tarried. Anne never woke to another
lonely day; always there was Sebastian
sitting by her, Sebastian holding her hand,
Sebastian bending over her, wise and tender.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whenever the fever left her, Anne was trying
to tell him something—something he would
not listen to then. But at last one day, lying
still and white, Anne suddenly spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Listen to me, Sebastian,’ she said, ‘for I’m
not long for this world; you can’t refuse to
hear me now.’ And with that she told him
all her story. Sebastian sat beside her, his
head bowed upon his hands, listening without
word or comment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Now that I be come to death’s dear, I’ve
but the one thought. Dick, he’s a man to
look out for hisself—and you was ever straight,
my man; but w’at’s to come of Phil? Lord,
I’d turn in my grave to think on him! for
sure he’s gotten part o’ my soul, Sebastian—he
hath truly.’ Sebastian did not speak, and
Anne went on—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Dick’ll fend for him an’ no fear—make a
fine gentleman of him most like—as fine as hisself,
and then teach him lyin’ ways an’ false
dealin’s, an’ my boy as hath half my soul he’ll
go down into hell with all the liars as find their
place there, and who’s to help?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still Sebastian did not speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Eh!’ cried Anne, half rising on her pillows.
‘This once I seen you hard, Sebastian!
’Tis no fault o’ the child’s—no, nor mine neither,
as he’s there.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You can scarce expect me to love him,
Anne,’ said Sebastian at last. ‘And what
help can I give the child?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Eh! none, none, my man; maybe Heaven’ll
help him,’ sobbed Anne, then she turned
and laid her hands in Sebastian’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘But as you love me,’ she said, ‘you’ll
make me this vow—you’ll swear to me if
ever you can help my poor Phil you’ll do it;
not for his own sake, Sebastian (an’ forgettin’
Dick Sundon an’ all his lies), but for
mine, as was Phil’s mother, and gave him half
her soul?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Annie, Annie, I’d do more than that for
you!’ said Sebastian. He prayed her then to
lie still—she had spoken beyond her strength.
Anne obeyed, and till late in the day she did
not speak again, then she spoke suddenly—half-wanderingly
this time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You’ll live long and happy, Sebastian,’ she
said; ‘you’ll marry, my pretty man, and another
woman but me, she’ll be the joyful
mother o’ your sons.’ Then with no change in
her voice, but as if she suddenly addressed a
third person in the room, she continued: ‘And,
God, you’ll avenge me on Dick Sundon?
You understand how it’s been with me, an’
how ’tis impossible I should forgive him?
And, Lord, have a care of Phil, and give him
a white heart—my caring of him be past an’
done with now.’ There fell a long silence
then, poor Anne having disposed of all her
earthly cares.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Come, Sebastian,’ she cried, then quickly—with
that awful chanting voice of the dying—and
she held out her arms to him. But even
as he bent down, Sebastian felt a long straining
shiver pass through her, the sorrows of
death compassed her, the pains of hell took
hold upon her. He caught her to his heart for
a moment, but a Stronger than he was drawing
Anne away from his embrace. As their lips
met she smiled a far-away dreamy smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Ha’ done, my man—ha’ done,’ she said;
‘no more of earth.’</p>

<hr class='tbk'>

<p class='pindent'>‘I’ll bury Annie,’ said Sebastian, ‘and then
I’ll kill Richard Meadowes.’</p>

<hr class='tbk'>

<p class='pindent'>It was in compliance with this resolution that
Sebastian Shepley, a few days later, waited
again upon Richard Meadowes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meadowes sat writing at the table with his
back to the door, but at the sound of its opening
he turned round, and at sight of his visitor
sprang up; the two men faced each other
silently for a moment. Sebastian’s eyes from
under their overhanging brows flashed like
blue flames.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I called you a liar,’ he said, advancing up
the room, ‘and for that mistake I crave your
pardon; you spoke truth, and now I am come
to fight you for the truth you spoke.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Fight with you, you damned surgeon! you
son of a village leech! I fight with gentlemen!’
said Meadowes scornfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘And I with men, so if you are one you had
best show it,’ retorted Shepley; and he drew
the sword that hung at his side with a drawing
rattle from its sheath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was not much question then between
them of rank. They fought with savage hatred
on either side; but from the first the fortunes
of the fight followed Sebastian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole had been ended, and ended with
it there would also have been the larger half of
this story, if an unaccountable impulse had not
moved Sebastian Shepley to mercy. Something,
perhaps, of the futility of revenge, now
that Anne was dead and could never know of
it, came to him of a sudden, and stayed his
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘There,’ he said. ‘You have your life at
my hand, for all it may be worth.’ And he
turned away as if to leave the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meadowes leant against the wall, breathing
hard after the struggle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Stop—one moment, Shepley,’ he said, ‘I—I
would speak with you; Anne Champion, if I
can find her, shall want for naught.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘She wants for naught now,’ said Shepley
shortly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘But,’ interposed Meadowes, ‘I should be
the man to provide for her, I looked to do that
always, I had indeed no intention——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Anne Champion is dead,’ said Shepley
slowly, pausing for a moment on the threshold.
‘Anne is dead, and her blood be upon you and
upon your children.’</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER X</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>The war was ended, the Peace of Utrecht
signed, and what remained of our armies after
the twelve years’ conflict was free to come
home once more. With the soldiers came back
the surgeons, to practise in peace the suggestive
proficiency they had gained in war-time; and
cleverest among them all was Dr. Sebastian
Shepley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like all successful doctors, Shepley owed
something to his personality. There was that
in him which inspired others with a sense of his
capacity. Not very much of a gentleman, but
very much of a man; of gigantic size and easy
rough address, he suggested all that was most
cheerful and prosperous in life. Shepley had
been through half the campaigns of the war,
and now that peace was proclaimed he had the
good luck to obtain an appointment under the
then celebrated Dr. Joseph Barrington of Harley
Street, Surgeon in Ordinary to his newly
ascended Majesty King George the First. The
appointment was a fortunate one for Shepley;
but perhaps it was not quite so fortunate for
Barrington, who found ere long that Sebastian
Shepley was likely to prove an Absalom who
would steal away the hearts of fashionable London
from himself. But Barrington was very
magnanimous—strangely magnanimous,—and
seemed rather to like than to dislike the praises
that were heaped upon the young man. The
reason of his magnanimity was not very far to
seek, nor had he any false delicacy in telling
Shepley of it; for, as they sat together one
day, the older man gave it as his opinion that
marriage was a prudent step for a young man
to take before taking up a practice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You should in truth be looking out for a
wife, Shepley,’ he concluded, and he gave a
suggestive cough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Some day, mayhap, sir, some day,’ said
Shepley. His face fell suddenly into a half
hard, half tragical expression, very foreign to
that it generally wore, and he passed his hand
quickly across his lips. Barrington, a keen observer
of faces, gave a sharp glance at him for
a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Such wounds, Shepley, are best treated not
too tenderly,’ he said. ‘It but keeps them
open.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘There may be truth in that you say, sir, but
it goes against nature,’ said Shepley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Like many a good drastic cure,’ said Barrington.
‘Come (if you will have my advice),
bury this old trouble, whatever it may be, and
begin life from where you are. Many a happy
match hath begun coolishly, many an ill one
hotly: and this is the wisdom of a man old
enough to be your father.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I thank you, sir; I shall give some thought
to the matter,’ said Shepley, and would have
changed the subject, but Barrington pursued—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You scarce need a proof of my goodwill;
Shepley; yet I’ll give you one. There’s not
another man in London to whom I would sooner
give my daughter Emma than yourself.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘My dear sir——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘There, there, I have but given you a piece
of my mind and something of a hint. Let the
matter rest. I pray you to be in no haste: no
prudent marriage was ever yet hasty, nor any
hasty one prudent; time, time and thought——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Yes, sir, as you say, time and thought—’tis
a great step in life,’ said Shepley. But he took
the older man’s hand in his as he spoke, and
shook it warmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I thank you, sir,’ he said. ‘And this story
you guess at—well, I give you my hand on’t
that if ever I marry Emma she hears it all.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Tush! keep your heart’s history to yourself,’
said Barrington, smiling. ‘The woman
who supposes herself any man’s first love is a
fool.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emma, whose name had been thus bandied
between Sebastian Shepley and her father, was
the younger of Dr. Barrington’s two daughters.
The elder daughter, Charlotte by name,
had married early, and ‘well,’ as the phrase
goes, having allied her fortunes with those of a
certain Sir James Mallow, who, though only a
knight, was the possessor of a handsome income,
and had converted Charlotte from plain
Miss Barrington without a fortune to ‘My
Lady’ with one. The marriage had been a
source of vast gratification to Emma as well as
to the fortunate Charlotte, for it seemed to be
in the very blood and bones of the Barringtons
to aspire in matters social. Their father’s promotion
to Court practice had given these young
women another help on the painful uphill path,
and had made it not only possible but quite
natural for them to mention persons of title
frequently in conversation. Now Emma drove
out daily in Lady Mallow’s coach, and dreamt
of even greater splendours to come. She was
an extremely pretty girl, slim and tall, with
fine auburn hair and delicate colouring. ‘With
her looks,’ said Lady Mallow, ‘Emma must
have a baronet.’ And indeed she repeated this
so often that Emma came to think of the baronet
as a reality, and never contemplated the
possibility of any suitor of lower degree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It gave her, therefore, quite a painful shock
to discover suddenly one fine day that she was
beginning to care a great deal about a man who
was not even distantly connected with a baronetcy.
Emma made this discovery some time
after Sebastian Shepley had been presented to
her; but she put the thought aside at first as
quite unworthy. To confirm herself in dismissing
such an idea, she spoke with some sharpness
to Charlotte about the spectral bridegroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I wish you would in truth present me to a
baronet, Charlotte, instead of speaking so frequently
of doing so,’ she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Charlotte was a little nettled by the remark,
probably because she knew no baronet whom
she could present to her sister, yet was unwilling
to acknowledge the fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I take good care to present no man to you
whom I do not consider suitable to be your
husband,’ she said coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I may get tired of waiting,’ said pretty
Emma. This was all she said then, but some
months later, in a burst of girlish despair, she
confided to Lady Mallow what she feared was
her hopeless passion for Dr. Sebastian Shepley.
‘I should not care for fifty baronets now,’ she
concluded, burying her face on Charlotte’s not
very sympathetic breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Tush! Emma,’ said her Ladyship; ‘you
should look higher——’ She could think of no
more weighty argument. But Emma could not
listen even to this. She sobbed and sobbed,
and prayed Charlotte, if she loved her, to try
to help her. For a long time Charlotte resisted
these entreaties, then she determined to tell her
father the state of the case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘So this is what ails Emma?’ he said.
‘Gad! but I’ll make short work with it.
Shepley is a fine man—no finer surgeon have I
come across this many a year. If he will take
Emma he shall have her, and welcome.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>So not very many days later, Dr. Barrington,
as you have heard, approached Shepley on the
subject of marriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first it seemed as if nothing were to come
of the conversation; then quite suddenly Shepley
came one day to announce to Dr. Barrington
that Emma had agreed to marry him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘My blessings on you for a sensible man,’
said Barrington. ‘You were so long about it
I half feared you would not take my counsel at
all.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I took it so well that I did not hurry in the
matter,’ laughed Sebastian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed himself down-stairs, laughed his
adieus to Emma, and swaggered off down the
street with his fine swinging gait, as gay and
hearty a man as you might see in all England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But oh, inscrutable heart of man! what
were these curious old words that so rang in
his ears? He seemed to be walking to the
tune of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘<span class='it'>If I forget thee</span>,’ said the voice of the heart
that speaks ever whitest truth,—‘<span class='it'>If I forget
thee, let my right hand forget its cunning.</span>’</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he shook his head and smiled, and looked
down at his clever right hand.</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER XI</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>Sebastian and Emma Shepley began their married
life in a little house in Jermyn Street—‘small,’
as Emma would have described it, ‘but
genteel.’ It would be impossible to exaggerate
the pride and pleasure which Emma had in the
arrangements of her house, and in the fact that
she was married to the (to her) finest and dearest
of men; but to Sebastian marriage appeared
in a very different light. For him it
showed as the end of Youth, the voluntary rejection
of romance, the light of common day.
He had reasoned himself into it; acknowledging
(and the man who does this need never
call himself young again) that he had better
take what he could get and be thankful for it.
He had laid Passion in the grave; and, turning
away, he met Life with her resolute face waiting
for him inexorable as of old. Marriage was
probably the first and most prudent step he
could take, and Emma was fond of him, and
Emma, after all, was pretty. A home, a wife,
children—these solid anchors of the soul, presented
themselves almost invitingly to his fancy
after a time—and farewell to Love and Youth!</p>

<p class='pindent'>In these curiously differing moods of mind
Emma and Sebastian entered into the estate of
matrimony—Sebastian with his eyes open,
Emma with hers firmly shut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Can two walk together except they be
agreed?’ asks that eternally unanswerable
book the Bible. Not comfortably, certainly,
but they can halt along somehow, far out of
step it may be, yet on the same road. I am
afraid that when all was said and done the
walk of Emma and Sebastian was somewhat
after this halting kind. For Emma had not
been married for many weeks before she began
to see how curiously she disagreed from Sebastian
on almost every point. Strange is the
glamour of love that she had not found this out
sooner! It said something for both of them
that after having made the discovery Emma
continued to love her husband as much as ever—only,
the glamour was gone now. He had
been to her a faultless romantic hero, she found
him to be a man with several pronounced faults,
who frequently offended her taste, who constantly
opposed her, who plainly told her that
he had once loved another woman, and loved
her memory still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sebastian on his part owned that Emma was
occasionally quite exasperating to him; but he
also acknowledged her entire goodness of heart
and the excellence of her housekeeping. Their
marriage in fact was just one of the ordinary
ruck of marriages; not unhappy, not ideal—merely
a little disappointing to Emma, a little
hardening and coarsening to Sebastian. The
great bone of contention was of a social nature.
For gentility was dear as life itself to Emma,
while to Sebastian all the little affectations and
conventions which his wife valued so highly
were the merest moonshine. He submitted
graciously enough to correction in matters of
etiquette, and laughed with imperturbable good
humour when Emma called him to task for eating
with his knife and wiping his lips with the
back of his hand. But when it came to the
question of friends and acquaintances matters
were more complicated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emma had, so to speak, passed her acquaintances
through a fine sieve, and the sifted few
who came through, they, and they alone, were
her intimates. Sebastian, on the other hand,
had only one reason for making friends with
any one—whether he liked them or not. As a
matter of fact he liked the greater part of the
world, and was liked by them in return, but
anything like an ulterior end in making acquaintances
was unknown to him. Emma’s
rules for the making of so-called friends, therefore,
filled him with amazement; while Emma,
on her part, looked with little short of dismay
upon the men whom Sebastian welcomed to his
table. Certainly there was scarcely one among
all his acquaintance that could have been called
a gentleman. ‘As why should they, Emma?
I am no gentleman myself,’ Sebastian had retorted
when taxed with his preference for low
company. Emma objected most of all to the
soldiers whom her husband had known abroad,
and who were continually coming to the house;
she might be entertaining her most select lady-friends
to a dish of tea, and talking the latest
Court gossip with them, when, into this refined
circle, and quite undismayed by its frigidly
genteel atmosphere, would enter Sebastian,
bringing with him, as likely as not, his friend
Sergeant Cartwright, or young Tillet the
bugler, who played at Ramillies. The Sergeant
had lost an arm at Blenheim, and Emma shrank
away instinctively from the empty sleeve he
wore pinned across his breast; no historic association
could reconcile her to the presence of
these men in her parlour, and when they were
bidden to supper Mrs. Shepley sat at the head
of the table with an air of studied aloofness
that was fine to see. Now and then she would
raise her pretty eyebrows expressively, as when
Cartwright spat on the floor, or Tillet made use
of expressions not usually heard in parlours;
but she came at last to see that remonstrance
with Sebastian on this score was useless, and
resigned herself as best she might to see the
hero of her first love make merry with such
friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But perhaps Emma’s sorest moments were
when those whom she naively termed ‘persons
of importance’ came to visit Sebastian. To
Emma, every one with a title was a person of
importance, be they never so unimportant in
reality, and it seemed to her that Sebastian intentionally
said and did the wrong things to
such personages. There was one terrible night
when ‘a Marquis’ (enough that the mystic
dignity was his) honoured the little house in
Jermyn Street with a visit, and Sebastian, all
unheeding of coughs and frowns from his wife,
must press this exalted visitor to sup with them.
Now on this ill-fated night Emma had chosen
to feed her lord and master on pig’s feet and
fried liver—viands whose price, or rather want
of price, is almost proverbial. It was, indeed,
from no sordid motives of economy that Emma
had so furnished forth her board, but from the
desire to please Sebastian, whose taste in food
was incurably vulgar. How could she have
anticipated that burning moment when her
faltering tongue must frame the words—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘My Lord, may I offer you some of these
pig’s feet, or mayhap your Lordship would relish
some of this fried liver more?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as if this was not bitter enough, did not
Sebastian break into a laugh that shook the
glasses on the table, crying out—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Faith, Emma, had you known we were to
entertain the quality to-night, I had not had my
liver and pig’s feet!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emma smiled faintly, for tears were not far
off; and the Marquis, seeing her perturbation,
told the story of the liver they got at Blenheim,
that the officers swore was shoe-leather,—‘A
different dish from your fine cookery,
madam,’ he said, begging for another helping
of the dish. But it was a life-long lesson to
poor Emma: she never ordered liver for supper
again without a pang of foreboding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the matter of Church observances had
arisen between these young people. Emma
was a devout Church-woman; Sebastian did
not hold much to one persuasion or another,
and certainly was not fond of Church services.
Emma all her life had gone every Sunday to
the curious little old church of St. Mary Minories,
and after her marriage expected Sebastian
to go there with her. The first Sunday morning
after her marriage Emma came down-stairs
in her church-going attire, and in rather a
shocked voice expressed her astonishment to
find Sebastian smoking by the fire, instead of
making any preparation for coming with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Charlotte will be here in the coach immediately,’
she said. ‘Hasten, Sebastian, we shall
be late at St. Mary’s.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘St. Mary’s?’ queried Sebastian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘St. Mary Minories, where it hath always
been our custom to attend divine service—come,
Sebastian, pray lay aside your pipe!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sebastian leant forward, pressing down the
tobacco into the bowl of his pipe. He made
no reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Are you not coming to church? Perhaps
some patients require your care——’ began
Emma. She came and laid her hand on his
shoulder in gentle remonstrance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘No, I cannot come.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Mayhap you might come to meet us—you
think little of such a walk,’ suggested Emma.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘No!’ said Sebastian curtly. Emma had
never seen him so cross before. Her eyes filled
with tears, and she withdrew her hand from
his shoulder, and turned away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I fear I have displeased you, sir!’ she said,
feeling a sudden inclination to desert this young
man, who could behave so strangely to her one
short week after their marriage. But the next
moment she forgave him; for Sebastian, at the
tearful sound of her voice, jumped up and came
over to where she stood, holding out his hands
to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Pardon me, Emma; ’tis no fault of yours,
but a fancy of my own. I never pass that way
an I can help it, Emma—that’s all.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Why——!’ began stupid Emma; but she
dried her tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Because Anne Champion lived there, and
there I saw her die, and I’m like to weep tears
of blood when I pass by that way,’ said Sebastian,
who, whatever he was, would have no
secrets from his wife, in spite of Dr. Barrington’s
wisdom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Emma had been a crafty woman she would
have discontinued her attendance at St. Mary
Minories after this; but she was not, and instead,
she went there weekly, and very frequently
she would say, ‘Sebastian, if so be that
you cannot worship along with me, why do
you not go to some other church?’ And
Sebastian scarcely knew whether to laugh more
at her singular lack of tact or to be provoked
by it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this sort of fashion time went on; and
then, whatever little differences there may have
been between the Shepleys, were forgotten for
a time in the wonderfully uniting interest which
came to them with the birth of their daughter.
All Emma’s first admiration for Sebastian returned
to her, when she saw how delightfully
he played the part of a father. And indeed, to
see him with this enchanting milky-skinned
baby in his arms was a sight to please any
heart; they looked so wholly incongruous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Lord! to think of your fathering such a
dainty piece of goods, doctor!’ exclaimed
Emma’s pet aversion, the Sergeant, at sight of
Sebastian and his tiny daughter. Emma was
too proud and pleased at the moment to find
fault with the speech, so, lifting little Miss
Shepley from her husband’s arms, she brought
her to be kissed by the Sergeant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘She is very beautiful,’ said the proud mother
in a conclusive manner, after the salute had
been very unwillingly given. ‘And we intend
to name her Caroline, after my mother.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>So let this be my reader’s first introduction
to Caroline Shepley.</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER XII</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>All observant (or is it only unobservant?) persons
must surely have remarked that children
seem to grow up suddenly in a night like Jack’s
bean-stalk. The child that only yesterday we
dandled in our arms, to-day runs about and
talks with the best of us, and to-morrow he
will be married, and the day after to-morrow
his children in their turn will be beginning the
whole curious magic mushroom-growth over
again for another generation! So those who
only in the last page saw Caroline Shepley in
long clothes will perhaps not be altogether surprised
to recognise her on this page as a child of
six years, trotting along the pavements under the
charge of a very good-looking young nurse-maid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seven years had not changed the ambitions
of Mrs. Shepley; but they had been transferred
during that period, and now she was no longer
ambitious for herself, but for her beautiful little
daughter Caroline.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Carrie must have a maid of her own, like
other gentlefolk’s children,’ she had said, and
though her husband laughed at the idea as pretentious
nonsense, he made no further objections,
and Mrs. Shepley engaged the services
of a young woman, Patty Blount, whose duty
it became to walk out daily with little Caroline,
as is the custom in all well-regulated families.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty, though not eminently conscientious in
other matters, performed this duty with the
most praiseworthy regularity. No sooner had
the hall-clock chimed eleven than this punctual
young person issued from the door of the little
house in Jermyn Street leading Caroline by the
hand. Their walks had a curious sameness,
tending as they almost invariably did in the
direction of St. James’ Square; and Carrie, a
conversational little person, noticed that about
the hour of their walk Patty was curiously absent-minded.
She was always looking round
her, and sometimes would even fairly stand
still, with an air of expectation as if she were
waiting for some one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last one morning as they sauntered through
the Square, the door of one of the houses
opened, and a young gentleman, Carrie’s senior
by some four years, came down the steps attended
by a tall man-servant wearing prune
liveries. Carrie, who was feeling very dull at
that moment, poor child, plucked her careless
companion by the skirt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘See, Patty,’ she whispered; ‘there is a boy
who must be nearly my own age.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty was not absent-minded now. She
seemed to have suddenly wakened up; and
giving Carrie that curious dragging shake
which seems an hereditary action in the nurse-maid
class, she turned her head pointedly in
the opposite direction from the approaching
figures, and hurried Carrie along the Square at
a great pace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You should think shame, Miss Carrie, to
be a-noticin’ of strangers in the streets,’ she
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They passed the boy and the tall footman as
she spoke, and turned the corner of the Square.
A moment later Carrie heard a voice behind
them address Patty, and turning round she
beheld the tall footman walking alongside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Lor’, Mr. Peter,’ exclaimed Patty, all affability
and surprise. Then she shoved Carrie
before her, and the footman shoved his charge
before him, and they turned back into the
Square again, apparently by mutual consent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The children looked at each other dumbly for
a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘What’s your name?’ then says Carrie,
taking the initiative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Philip-William-Richard-Frederick-Sundon-Meadowes.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Oh, that’s far too long; I can never say
that.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Well, Phil they call me.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Yes, that will do; I am called Caroline—I
was named after my grandmother.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I was named after my grandfather. I
never saw him; he was dead long before I
began.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Was he? my grandfather is still alive,’ said
Carrie. ‘But he is not like my father at all;
I love my father more than any one.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Well, do you know, Caroline, I do not love
my father at all,’ said Phil with curious candour.
As he spoke he turned and looked at
Carrie with a pair of wonderfully glittering
grey eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘O, what strange eyes you have, Phil!
Why do they cut into me?’ cried Carrie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil was rather offended. ‘My eyes are
quite as good as yours, Caroline,’ he said. ‘I
think I shall return to Peter.’ And with an
air of great dignity he fell back a step or two.
But Peter and Patty were deep in conversation,
nor would they allow themselves to be interrupted
for all Phil’s dignity. So after a minute
or two of sullenness, Phil was forced to rejoin
Carrie, and make overtures of peace by silently
placing a hand on the hoop she trundled, and
giving an interrogative grunt. Carrie had
nothing to forgive: the pavement was clear
before them for many tempting yards, and off
they ran with shouts of pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘This is where I live,’ said Phil, as they
reached the house he had appeared from.
‘Look, Carrie, when Peter is in good temper,
or if I can catch my father as he goes out, I
can get them to put me on their shoulders, and
then I am so high up that I can get my hand
into the torch-snuffer; it comes out black, I
can tell you!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie looked longingly at the torch-snuffer;
she too would have liked to blacken her plump
white fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Shall I ask Peter? he looks pleased,’ said Phil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Do,’ urged Carrie in great excitement, peering
up into the snuffer. ‘ ’Tis like an iron
nightcap,’ she added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘ ’Tis not often Peter will do it, for you see
he has to wash my hands,’ said Phil. ‘Father
is better. O good luck, Carrie, here he
comes!’ for as the children stood together on
the steps, the great door with its iron knocker
swung open, and a man came out, closing the
door behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Hillo, Phil! alone? Where hath Peter
disappeared to? And who is the lady you have
forgathered with?’ he said, as he looked down
in amusement at the children. Peter came
swinging along the Square, red to his powdered
locks, and Patty, overcome with confusion,
stood still at some distance and beckoned to
Carrie to run to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘O no, sir, I am not alone; Peter is talking
to a woman there, and——’ said Phil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘And you are following his example,’ laughed
Phil’s father. ‘And what is your name, my
little lady?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie was smitten with sudden shyness, and
thought of beginning to cry. She thrust her
dimpled hand into her eye and rubbed it hard,
and did not speak. Peter came up breathless
and apologetic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I was but speaking with a friend, sir,’ he
exclaimed; ‘an’ Master Phil he did run away
along the Square, sir, and——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Tush, Peter, there is little harm done,’ said
his master, and would have passed on, but Phil
barred his path.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘If you please, sir, Caroline would like to
put her hand into the torch-snuffer: will you
lift her?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘And what will Caroline’s maid say?’
laughed Phil’s father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Nothing, sir, if you do it,’ Phil urged, and
at that his father stooped down and swung
Carrie up on to his shoulder, and bade her
poke her fingers into the envied grime of the
snuffer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘And now give me a kiss for it,’ he said;
and Carrie, her shyness quite cured by the delightfully
black aspect of her fingers, gave the
salute with great freedom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Wasn’t that most agreeable?’ asked Phil;
he alluded not to the kiss, but to the soot.
Patty at this moment, seeing some interference
necessary, came forward with a curtsey to claim
her charge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I fear I have led your little lady into mischief,’
said Phil’s father to her, smiling very
pleasantly. Patty murmured incoherent excuses,
curtseyed again, and bade Carrie say
good-day to the gentleman. As they walked
away Carrie heard Phil’s voice—it was singularly
clear—echoing along the quiet Square.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Caroline, sir.’ And then, in reply to another
question—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Caroline, sir; I do not know what else.’
It was well for Carrie that she could not overhear
what followed—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘A child of singular beauty.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Peter,
who is she?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I—I cannot say, sir. I am slightly acquainted
with the young woman as looks after
her, sir,’ said Peter, and he looked so ashamed
of himself, and so uncomfortable, that his master
did not question him further, but passed
down the steps, laughing as he went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty on the homeward way was very silent.
When they reached Jermyn Street she took
Carrie straight up-stairs and closed the nursery
door. Then she stood in front of the child
menacingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Mind, Miss Caroline, if ever you do say to
master or to mistress one word of meeting with
this little gentleman, I’ll—I’ll lock you up in
a black hole.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Why, Patty?’ began Carrie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Well, you had best ask no questions, or mayhap
I’ll put you in the hole for that,’ said
Patty; and then, because in the main she was
a good-hearted girl, and hated to frighten Carrie,
she kissed the child and assured her over
and over again that if no word of this meeting
ever crossed her lips, she would have chestnuts
to roast on the ribs of the nursery grate, and
nuts to eat by the handful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Carrie agreed to be silent.</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>Now so pleasant and easy is it to tread the
primrose path, that after the first difficulty of
being silent about her new playmate was got
over, Carrie never thought about the matter,
and it became quite a daily thing that the children
met and walked together while Patty and
Peter sauntered in the rear, very much occupied
with each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil was a curious boy, of great strength of
character: a hot-tempered, domineering child,
horribly clever for his age, very imaginative,
and withal sadly spoilt. Peter, it is true, held
his young master in very scant reverence, and
would speak to him at times with great sharpness,
but his was the only control that was ever
exercised over the child. Carrie, who had no
temper at all, was frightened almost out of her
little judgment the first time she saw Phil in
one of his worst fits of anger. They were
walking in St. James’ Park, and Phil began to
throw stones into the water at the water-fowl,
spluttering his fine new velvet suit at each
splash.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Mustn’t be after that game, Master Phil,’
said Peter, and Phil continued his stone-throwing
with aristocratic indifference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Did you hear, Master Phil? You’re spoilin’
them new clothes,’ said Peter, and approaching
to where Phil stood he forcibly removed
the stones from his hands. Phil’s face
was convulsed in a moment with horrid passion.
He fell on his knees on the walk and scraped
up the mud and gravel in handfuls, pelting the
stately Mr. Peter’s calves in futile anger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I shall do as I please, Peter; you are a servant,
and you shall not stop me throwing stones—there—and
there—and there.’ He emphasised
each word with another handful of gravel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie drew away to Patty’s side, shocked
into silence. Patty said ‘Lor’,’ and Peter
smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘ ’E’s a little imp,’ he said; ‘there’s but the
one way to manage him,’ And with that he
lifted Phil suddenly to his feet, shook him
sharply, and boxed his ears till the child began
to cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘There, that’ll settle you,’ he said. He
pushed poor Phil before him along the path,
and stooped down to brush from his immaculate
stockinged legs the marks of this ignoble conflict.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie, being admonished by Patty to rejoin
her companion, advanced rather timidly towards
him. Phil was quite white now, and shook all
over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I think I shall go home now, Peter,’ he said
in a very humble little voice; ‘I feel most terribly
tired—will you take me home?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Yes, Master Phil,’ said Peter, quite pleasantly,
and with adieux to Carrie and Patty,
they walked off together up the Mall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Lor’! what a life Mr. Peter do lead with
the boy!’ said Patty occultly. Carrie was
silent, and watched the retreating forms of the
little Phil and the mighty Peter till they became
merged in the throng.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they came to see more and more of each
other the children’s intercourse assumed a
definite character, which one often notices in
childish friendships. Phil, as the elder and
more original-minded of the two, assumed as it
were command, led the conversation, and Carrie,
deeply admiring his powers of mind, and
quite content to be commanded, took all her
ideas from him. Phil indeed was vastly entertaining
to her after the pre-occupied silence of
Patty, but sometimes his views rather startled
her childish fancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had gone far afield one fine day in late
autumn—even to the Park—a world of delight
to the children, and Peter and Patty, having
seated themselves under one of the trees, Phil
and Carrie followed the example of their elders
and sat down also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I wish God would come,’ said Phil suddenly,
gazing up through the branches above him.
‘Do you not, Carrie?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘No—o,’ admitted the feeble-minded Carrie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I do, and I shall tell you why. Peter took
me to his meeting-house, where they pray without
a book, and they prayed, “<span class='it'>Rend the heavens
and come down</span>.” Well, since that I’ve lain
down whenever I’ve got a chance and looked
up into the sky. ’Tis too bright to look into
nicely most days, but if God were to make a
rent in that blue bit we see’ (he pointed up as
he spoke, and Carrie glanced upwards, half expecting
to see some Beatific Vision), ‘if He
were to make a hole to come down through, you
know, we should see something brighter than
that behind, I believe. And then He’d come
down—oh, like that!’ Phil brought his hands
together with a crack that made Carrie jump.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I’d be frightened,’ she said, taking a reassuring
peep at the placid blue that smiled
above them. It showed no signs of cracking
open, she thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Pooh,’ said Phil contemptuously. ‘I believe
you had rather that the other God came—the
Jesus God. He is quite different, and
will not come the same way at all. I fancy
He’d <span class='it'>walk</span> into the town: coming the Richmond
way perhaps, about the blossomy time of
the year. We would just be walking along
Piccadilly perhaps, and we’d see every one
turning to look, and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil’s imagination gave out here; he had not
given enough of thought to the subject to
visualise it perfectly, so he returned to his former
and more favourite imagining—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Now what pleases me about t’other God
coming would be the noise—drums, and bugles.
Don’t you love ’em, Carrie? I went with my
father to the Horse Guards t’other day. Oh,
you should have heard it! Well, God will
have gold bugles of course—the ones I heard
were just tin, I think—and the gold bugles and
God’s drums together, they’d make a noise no
one could get away from. Now what do you
suppose every one we know would do? I wonder
what my father would do? Peter would
come running up the back stair to look after <span class='it'>me</span>—I’m
sure of that—in case I was afraid. Not
that I would be,’ he added hastily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘When do you think it will happen?’ asked
Carrie, very much awed, though Phil had finished
off with a shrill little twirl of laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Oh, perhaps next week, or perhaps to-night,
Peter says. I believe God will come down on
the gilt top of St. Paul’s myself. Such a fine
place to land on from the sky,’ continued the
little prophet, inspired as all prophets are by a
credulous audience. ‘He’d—He’d—oh, I
don’t know what I was going to say. Carrie,
look round the tree and see if Peter is kissing
Patty, for I want to climb the tree, and ’tis
safe to begin if he’s doing that.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie obediently reconnoitred; ‘I think
he’s going to,’ she reported. ‘He has his arm
round her waist, and he always begins that way.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Come on then,’ said the prophet, leaving
the Second Advent unceremoniously behind
him, as he addressed himself to the ascent of a
very smutty tree-trunk, much to the detriment
of his own and Carrie’s finery.</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>One day not very long after this Patty came
into the nursery breathless and agitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Lord save us! Miss Carrie, what do you
think? Master Phil hath near killed himself!
I’m but just in from a message, and who should
I meet but Mr. Peter, running like mad, and
with never a hat to his head! ’Taint often as
Mr. Peter passeth by me in the street, but he
waved and passed on without one word, and
up to the door of Dr. James and kicks till the
door do near split across. When he’d given
his message he found time to return to where I
was a-standin’—for in troth I had such a terror
at the sight of Mr. Peter flyin’ down the street
that I stood as if I had the palsy, and must so
stand there till he returned. “Well, Mr.
Peter,” I said, “you seem pressed for time
this day.” “Miss Patty,” saith he (and believe
me he could scarce get out the words for
agitation),—“<span class='it'>Miss Patty, my young master’s
near burned to death</span>.” ’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty was breathless with agitation herself
at this point, and to recover her breath and relieve
her surcharged feelings she seized a brush
and began to arrange Carrie’s locks with more
energy than gentleness. Carrie, deeply stirred
by this tale, listened in great anxiety for further
details. Patty then proceeded—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Being dinner-time, all the house was still,
and Master Phil slips from the nursery and into
the master’s own room he do go, and commences
playing with the log fire. He hath a
great fancy for pilin’ on the logs, same as he
seeth Mr. Peter a-doing, and he’d lifted one
too heavy an’ overbalanced hisself into the
fire. He’d on a silk suit with ruffles, and it
fired direct, and the whole body of him was
blazing in a moment. The master’s gentleman,
as was in the dressing-room a-putting away of
the master’s clothes, he came running in and
pulled Master Phil out from the heart o’ the
fire! They’d a business tearing off his clothes!
and now there he do lie in the master’s own
bed a-screamin’ in agony.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie was deeply impressed; it was not her
nature to weep easily over anything, but she
approached the nursery fire and stood gazing at
the cruel element that had worked such sad
havoc on her poor little playmate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty, with hysteric exclamations, pulled her
back and declared she would never have an
easy moment again—never. But a few moments
later she found it necessary to flounce off
to the kitchen, to repeat her tale there with
many sappy additions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie, thus deserted, quietly drew her little
chair close to the fire, and looked at the flames
with a very serious face. She even extended
one of her fat little fingers towards the bars experimentally,
withdrawing it, however, with
less caution, and a moment later she said ‘Poor
Phil!’ with heart-felt compassion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty ran in then, and shook her roughly.
‘What did I say, Miss Carrie?—never beyond
the rug, and there you do sit close in to the
very blaze! How, Miss Carrie, mind you obey
me better, and partickerly in this, never to say
one word of Master Phil to the master or the
mistress. And if so be you do, well, of this
I’m sure as I stand in my shoes: you’ll never
play again with Master Phil so long as you
live.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie did not in the least understand the
reason of all this mystery about Phil; but she
reiterated once more her promise of secrecy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night as she curtseyed to her parents at
bedtime, she said suddenly—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Doth burning hurt, dada?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sebastian laughed. ‘Are you going to the
stake, Carrie?’ he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘No, not <span class='it'>me</span>,’ said Carrie, with some congratulation
in her tones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day, some three weeks after this, Patty
said mysteriously to Carrie that they were
going out that afternoon to pay a visit. ‘We
are to see Master Phil,’ she said, when they
were in the street; and Carrie jumped for joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘O Patty, I am so glad! Is he better?
Where are we to see him?’ she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘In his bed, miss, but mind if ever you do
say a word——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie was quite impatient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You are most strange about Phil, Patty,’
she said; ‘I am sure he is nicer far to speak
about than any one else I know.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Oh, well, Miss Carrie, we’ll be going home
then; we’ll say no more about the visit,’ said
Patty, making a feint of turning back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘No, no, ’tis all right, I shall say nothing,’
said Carrie. On the steps of the great house,
which Carrie knew quite well now, she saw the
familiar figure of Mr. Peter, evidently waiting
for them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I’ll trouble you to enter by the back way,’
he said, as he greeted them, and with that he
conducted his visitors to the kitchen regions.
Everything here was bustle and hurry, for up-stairs
dinner was being served. They met a
French cook in a white paper cap dashing out
of the kitchen with a saucepan in his hand, and
ran against another man-servant, as tall as Mr.
Peter, who carried a silver dish. Then, leaving
these regions, they began to climb long,
long stairs, and came out at last on to a polished
oak corridor hung with pictures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Lor’, Mr. Peter, this be terrible fine!’ said
Patty, quite overawed. Mr. Peter sniffed, and
affected great unconsciousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Walk quiet, if you please,’ he said, ‘and on
the carpet, missie; these floors do mark very
easy with boot-marks.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>He opened a door very cautiously, and looked
into a large fire-lit room. It was very still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘ ’Ere’s a visitor for you, Master Phil,’ said
Mr. Peter, stepping on tiptoe towards a huge
canopied bed which occupied the side of the
room and faced the fire. With a sign to Carrie
to follow him, Mr. Peter drew back one of the
satin curtains, and then, followed by Patty,
tiptoed away again into the adjoining room.
Carrie crept up to the side of the bed and peered
into its tent-like depths. There lay Phil,
propped up with pillows, white and thin, his
shining restless eyes moving ceaselessly round
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Well,’ said Carrie, after the unemotional
manner of children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Hullo!’ said Phil. He started up in bed,
and then fell back against the pillows with a
cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie was tremendously impressed by all
she saw around her:—the size and grandeur of
the room, the satin hangings of the bed, embroidered
all over with crests and coats of
arms, the silk coverlet under which Phil reposed,
the solemn quiet of the room, and the
weird whiteness of her little companion’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was all indelibly stamped upon her memory
in a moment, a scene never to be forgotten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laid her little hand on the stiff silk cover
and found nothing to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Oh, I’m glad to see you, Carrie,’ said Phil
then, who was never at a loss for words. He
tossed his head restlessly about as he spoke.
‘They do not let me play, or anything, since I
have been ill.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Do you hurt much?’ asked Carrie, to
whom pain was an unknown mystery and
dignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Yes, my hands hurt most terribly; see,
each finger is tied up by itself in a little
bag—that is why I cannot play with anything.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Shall I whistle to you?’ asked Carrie,
struck by a sudden inspiration. ‘A friend of
my father’s has taught me to whistle, and he
says I do it to admiration.’ She jumped on to
the edge of the bed, flung back her head, and
whistled off a gay little roulade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil laughed delightedly. ‘O do that again;
you look like the poodles I saw in Paris. They
threw back their heads and howled in a chorus,’
he cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Well, you pretend you are the other poodle,’
said Carrie; ‘I find it difficult whistling alone.
Mr. Tillet, who teaches me, always whistles
with me.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Who’s Tillet?’ asked Phil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘He’s a soldier—a man my father knows.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘A soldier! oh, I suppose he will be a general—they
are all generals,’ said Phil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I think he is a bugler—is that the same?—something,
I suppose; they all fight.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Well, never mind; do it again, Carrie, ’tis
such fun to see you.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘My mother does not like me to whistle,’
said Carrie, ‘but my father is ever teaching me
new tunes, and Mr. Tillet, so I have to learn,
but, if you please, I had rather look round the
room, Phil; I want to look into that long mirror.’
So Carrie slipped down off the bed and
walked (by irresistible feminine instinct drawn)
towards the long French mirror, the like of
which she had never seen before, and then she
played for a few minutes with the Dresden
china dishes on the dressing-table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You take care with my father’s razors,’
warned Phil; ‘but they are not there—I forgot
he wasn’t sleeping here. I have this room
all to myself, and oh! it’s gloomy at night.
You see that big wardrobe over there—well, I
think all manner of things come out of it
through the night. You see sometimes Peter
sits with me, and sometimes nurse, but they
both often go asleep, and then——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moved by this recital of nightly terrors, Carrie
came back to the side of Phil’s bed and took
another compassionate look at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I am so tired of lying here,’ he said crossly.
‘And you know, though my father makes a lot
of me when I am well sometimes, he never
comes near me now that I am ill—just when I
would like him. My father is rather amusing
sometimes, you know.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘What would he amuse you with?’ asked
Carrie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Oh, he teaches me a number of things. He
can swear beautifully. I have learnt some of
that, but when I used one of his expressions
the other day they all laughed at me; ’twas
rather hard, I thought. My father said:
“Bravely tried, Phil, but you scarce apply it
rightly yet,” and they all laughed again. I
shall not learn for him again in a hurry.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie was very sympathetic, and Phil continued—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Then I play sometimes with him—we have
shilling points; ’tis good fun that, Carrie, but
my father says just now I am too cross to play
with.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Oh, let me play with you,’ Carrie cried,
‘I have learnt that too.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil rolled over uneasily on his pillows.
‘Peter,’ he called, in a very lordly fashion,—‘Peter,
bring a pack of cards.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter obeyed with some reluctance. ‘See
you ain’t a-hurtin’ of your hands, Master Phil,’
he said. ‘You let missie shuffle an’ deal, like
a good young gen’l’man.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Oh, you be damned, Peter!’ said Phil
hastily, and Peter disappeared into the other
room, drawing up his shoulders to his ears in a
very expressive fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Now, you sit on the end of the bed, Carrie,
and we’ll have a jolly time,’ said Phil, his ill-temper
as quickly gone as it had come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie scrambled up on to the stiff yellow
satin coverlet, and dealt out the cards across it,
while Phil obligingly flattened out his poor
little burnt knees to form an even table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were deep in their game, when Patty
came to take Carrie home. Phil’s cheeks were
pink with excitement, and he called out to
Peter to go away and let them play on. But
Peter, with great unconcern, swept together
the cards that lay on the quilt and lifted Carrie
to the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Peter, you are a beast; leave these cards,
I tell you!’ cried Phil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Sorry, Master Phil, ’tis too late,’ said Peter,
extending his hand towards the cards that Phil
still held; ‘missie must be goin’ now.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie stood on tiptoe to wave a better adieu
to her playmate, but Phil did not notice her;
he was gathering together all his sick little
strength to avenge himself on the inexorable
Peter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘There, you devilled flunkey!’ he screamed,
pitching the cards into Peter’s face and falling
back against the pillows with a sharp cry of
pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter covered the child gently with the bed-clothes,
gathered up the cards in silence, and
signed to Patty and Carrie to follow him out of
the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘That’s some of the master’s speech he’s
pickin’ up,’ he said, with a shake of the head;
‘he don’t swear very skilful, as you may see,
Miss Patty—no fear but he’ll get at that yet,’
he added, with a half smile, half sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie, rather awed at this scene, took tight
hold of Patty’s hand and did not speak till they
were well out in the street again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I do not think Phil is very happy,’ she said
then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Not he, Miss Carrie—not for all his grand
house an’ altogether, for he’s a bad boy he is,’
responded the moral Patty.</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER XV</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>It was a long time until Carrie saw Phil again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Master Phil hath gone off to the country to
establish his ’ealth,’ Patty said, and it seemed
as though he would never return again, Carrie
thought; for often as she sighed for her little
companion, he did not come, and finally Patty,
who seemed to have occult communication with
the household in St. James’ Square, informed
her that Phil had gone to school. Patty wept
as she gave this bit of information, and Carrie,
partly, it must be confessed, out of the imitative
faculty, wept also at the news. Time,
they say, dries every tear—perhaps it does—certainly
Carrie’s were soon dried; but she remembered
Phil long and tenderly for all that,
and used to ask Patty at intervals if she was
never going to see him again. Patty always
answered these questions with a burst of tears,
which response had such a sobering effect upon
Carrie that she at last feared to make the inquiry.
But one day, fully a year from the date
of Phil’s accident, as Patty and Carrie walked
round the Square together they met a tall lad,
having the shining eyes of Phil, but changed,
it seemed, in every other way beyond recognition.
He was walking along with another
boy, and passed by Carrie with an unregarding
stare. Carrie stood still, stamped her little
foot in anger, and turned to Patty for sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘ ’Twas Phil, Patty!’ she cried, ‘and he
passed me without knowing me!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty gave her head an upward toss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Pay no heed to him, Miss Carrie; the men
are all alike—not one to mend another,’ she
said scornfully. They were passing at that
moment the door whence the magnificent Peter
had been wont to appear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie, however, was not so easily answered.
She followed Phil’s retreating figure as it disappeared
round the Square, before she spoke
again, then she said, with great decision—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘There goes my husband that is to be,
Patty.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Lor’! have a care what you say in the
streets, Miss Carrie!’ cried Patty, with a delighted
giggle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus Phil passed out of Carrie’s life for the
time being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not an age of learned women, so
though Carrie began her education about this
time, she was not the disquieting receptacle of
knowledge that modern childhood sometimes is
in our progressive age. Carrie learned to read
and write, she could do a little arithmetic, and
began to sew a sampler of intricate stitchery;
but she could not analyse her native tongue, or
speak in any other, and I fear even her knowledge
of geography was very hazy. Indeed, if
the truth must be told about Carrie, she was
entirely unintellectual in every way. Lessons
were nothing but a pain to her, and as in these
days a woman was not thought to add to her
charms by wisdom, Carrie was not compelled
to pursue her studies after she had attained to
a certain very easy standard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was compelled, however, to learn all the
housekeeping arts, and Mrs. Shepley expected
nothing short of perfection in this branch of education.
By the time Carrie was thirteen there
was a good deal of friction between the mother
and daughter. For Carrie, to her want of
intellectuality, added a supreme carelessness,
which was agonising to her conventional parent.
If she had been an incapable girl it would have
been different; but Carrie was far from incapable.
When she chose, no girl of her age could
accomplish any household task better. Yet,
where it was a question of pleasure, Carrie
would fling aside every duty and amuse herself
without a thought. She had indeed a whole-heartedness
of joy in living, that would have
reconciled almost any one except Mrs. Shepley
to her heedless ways. But to her they were
unpardonable, and the worst of it all was, that
Carrie’s father encouraged her in her careless
habits—making it almost useless for her to
remonstrate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How it would have fared between the mother
and daughter later in life is hard to say. They
were both spared this test. For soon after
Carrie’s fourteenth birthday was past, Mrs.
Shepley fell ill of a lingering disorder, and lay
for many a long month between life and death.
Carrie grew less careless in these months of
anxiety, grew quieter also, poor child—never
shut the doors noisily, and almost forgot how
to whistle, while Sebastian went about with a
very grave face. Now that Emma was so ill,
he recognised what a good wife she had been
to him in spite of all her failings, and realised
too what it would mean to him should he be
left with Carrie motherless on his hands.
Whatever Emma’s faults had been, she had
been a careful mother, and had given a zealous
watchfulness to everything concerning Carrie
that he never could have time to give.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must have been weighing on Emma’s mind
also, this matter of how Carrie was to get
on without her, but she looked at it in a
characteristic light. Almost with her latest
breath she called Sebastian to her bedside to
pray him to be particular about Carrie’s associates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Let Charlotte Mallow see that Carrie makes
no friends out of her own situation in life—beneath
her, in fact.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Lord, Emma, the girl’s all right. I am
here to protect her,’ said Sebastian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘ ’Tis the old trouble, Sebastian—you do not
see what I mean.—Ah! let her grow up a gentlewoman.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I’ll do my best, Emma,’ he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I pray you to send her to church each Lord’s
Day,’ pursued Mrs. Shepley. ‘Send her with
Charlotte; you have ever been careless of the
Church and its mysteries.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘To church she shall go,’ said Sebastian—‘if
that will make her a gentlewoman,’ he
added to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Mrs. Shepley, with her little gentilities
and punctilios, her tactless ways and her zeal
for ordinances, went the way of all flesh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sebastian was not broken-hearted, though
the house felt empty enough, he thought, without
poor Emma; and Carrie, after the first solemn
months of mourning were over, missed her
mother sadly little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She lived a perfectly happy unconstrained
existence, which accorded well with her simple
nature. Sebastian, who was nothing if not
truthful, sent her to church weekly with Lady
Mallow, and these were the dreariest hours of
Carrie’s otherwise unclouded childhood. Each
Sunday morning Lady Mallow appeared with
horrible regularity, driving in a singularly
gloomy-looking coach, which seemed to Carrie
to swallow her up as she entered it. In silence
they drove through the crowded streets (which
on Sunday had a way of looking very gloomy
too), and the coach drew up before the door of
that sad little building, the church of St. Mary
Minories. Lady Mallow occupied one of those
carved oak pews which to this day you may
see mouldering away in the church, and there
in its genteel obscurity Carrie sat, with a sinking
heart, counting the slow-passing minutes
till she could breathe the fresher air of the
everyday world again. Patty had once told
her that ‘persons of quality was buried in ’eaps
under the floor in St. Mary Minories,’ and
Carrie’s imagination hovered over this gruesome
thought. She somehow connected that
damp old smell which clings about the church
with the ‘heaps an’ heaps of persons of quality’
lying in their shrouds under the chancel, and
each day as she asserted her belief in the resurrection
of the body, found herself wondering
how the poor dead people would ever work
their way up through those slabs of stone. So
Carrie required all the fortitude and cheerfulness
which she inherited from her father to sustain
the ordeal of Sunday’s gloom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Service once over, however, she stepped into
the auntly coach with a much lighter heart.
The drive home seemed an altogether different
matter from the drive to church, and each step
of the way Carrie’s spirits mounted higher and
higher, till, when the coach drew up before the
door, she could have danced for joy. Bidding
a decorous adieu to her aunt, Carrie was handed
out by the man-servant, and mounted the steps
to the door with the greatest propriety. But
it was well that the departing rumble of the
wheels hid from Lady Mallow’s ear that whoop
of joy which Carrie uttered as she raced into
the parlour and flung her arms round her
father’s neck, crying out,</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘ ’Tis done—done for another week, sir!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Shepley had never permitted such demonstrative
greetings—they were indeed considered
a great breach of decorum in those days;
but I fear many polite rules were broken in
upon by Carrie and her father, who neither of
them cared as much as they should have done
for the generally received ideas of the society
of their day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such good friends were Carrie and her father
that the girl sought for no friends of her own
age; she went about everywhere with Sebastian
when he had leisure to escort her, and
when he was busy she amused herself at home,
very well content with life and all things. In
her father’s company she visited many a strange
scene; she would go with him to the hospitals
sometimes, and—shade of Mrs. Shepley!—how
many a sight she saw in these unsavoury tents
of disease! Then Carrie entertained all her
father’s friends (those motley friends her poor
mother had objected to so much), and in many
ways grew up with more of the manners of a
boy than of a girl. She was singularly free
from the sillinesses and affectations of early girlhood,
having heard no talk at all of lovers or
admiration, nor having ever entered into rivalry
with other women in the matter of looks and
charm. Carrie was serenely unconscious that
the world held a rival for her; she was the first
with all the men of her own little world, and
as yet she had not gone beyond it. If she compared
her own looks with those of other girls,
it was merely from curiosity quite untouched
by jealous feeling. The fact was only distantly
dawning upon her that she was fair beyond the
common; just now she took it as her due from
Fortune’s kindly hand.</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Caroline Shepley, up to the age of seventeen
years, had perhaps, in her own way, lived
as happy a life as it is granted to many young
persons to live. She looked like it too; wearing
that air of pleased good humour that is a
passport to every heart, and blooming like a
rose, in spite of the fact that she had never
been out of London all her days. Carrie was
very tall, with just the same fearless brilliant
blue eyes that her father had, but from her
mother she had inherited a skin as white as
milk, with a clear pink colour in the cheeks,
two bewitching dimples, and ringlets of deep
red hair. To see her pass along the streets!—— Do
they grow now-a-days, these shining beauties
that brightened the world of long ago, or
is it that they are so common we scarcely regard
them? But as time went on, Carrie’s
good looks became such as to be quite embarrassing
both to herself and to her father, for
she could never go out alone, and even in
his company attracted a vast deal of attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Now,’ said Sebastian, ‘I shall send Carrie
to the country with her aunt, as she has so
often been pressed to go, else her head will be
turned altogether.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Mallow’s establishment certainly promised
to be dull enough for safety. Her Ladyship,
who was rich enough to indulge in fancies
about climate, had taken an idea that London
did not suit her health. On her brother-in-law’s
suggestion, she had taken a house in the
neighbourhood of Wynford, and there was
passing the summer months in genteel and
plethoric seclusion—for alas! Lady Mallow was
becoming stout in middle life. From all he remembered
of Wynford twenty years ago,
Sebastian smiled to think of the conventual existence
poor Carrie might lead there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You must go to the village of Wynford and
see where your grandfather sold drugs; but
there’s not one of our name left there now,’ he
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Sir! my dear sir! what would my aunt
Charlotte say should I propose to visit where
any one related to me had traded in anything,
at any time?’ said Carrie—and indeed she was
right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So one splendid May morning Lady Mallow’s
coach drew up before the door of the Shepleys’
house, and the beautiful Carrie came out upon
the steps, drawing on her long gloves, while
her baggage was stowed away in the rumble of
the coach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Well, Carrie, adieu to you, and Heaven
bless you!’ said her father; and Carrie, unconventional
as usual, turned suddenly, in the
full view of her aunt’s decorous footman, flung
her arms round Sebastian, and kissed him tenderly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I do not wish to leave you, sir; I had rather
far stay with you,’ she cried; but Sebastian
laughed at her, and bade her not keep those
spirited animals which her aunt drove ‘waiting
upon her sentimentalities.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>The spirited animals waddled off down the
street very deliberately, and Carrie sat back in
the coach and waved her hand till she was out
of sight. Though she had not been altogether
pleased to leave home, it would certainly be a
new and delightful thing to leave London
smoke behind her, and drive far out into the
wonderful green country. No train had yet
snorted through these fair English meadows,
and the depth of their tranquillity was like a
dreamless sleep. To the heart that has known
sorrow—and perhaps more to the heart that
has missed joy—the jubilant burgeoning of
spring will sometimes bring an intolerable sadness.
But in the first blossom and fairness of
her youth, with her sunny childhood barely
left behind, with hope ahead, these stainless
blue skies, and the rich promise of the bursting
leafage, filled Carrie’s heart with a sort of
ecstasy. She fairly clapped her hands at the
hackneyed old sight of a meadow where lambs
were gambolling, and called out to the coachman,
praying him to stop and let her buy a
drink of milk at a cottage door where a cow
was being milked. Towards the end of the
day these pleasures began to pall a little, and
when at last the coach drew up at Lady Mallow’s
door Carrie was not sorry to alight. The
forty miles that lay between her and London
seemed very long in the retrospect, and a sudden
chill of home-sickness fell over her spirit as
she entered the decorous portals of her aunt’s
abode. ‘I wonder why I ever came,’ she
thought. ‘Aunt Charlotte will fidget me to
death—and I shall be so dull, and I think London
is ever so much nicer than the country.’
We must all be familiar with such misgivings,
and familiar too with the extraordinary difference
which a night’s rest makes in such a case.
Carrie rose up next morning with much more
rose-coloured views of life. ‘Aunt Charlotte
is vastly dull, but how agreeable to be here!—and
O how beautiful, how beautiful!’ she said
as she gazed out at the new surroundings, smelt
the country sweetness, and longed for breakfast.
Lady Mallow, indeed, was quite shocked
by Carrie’s appetite. ‘You will become stout,
my dear,’ she said. ‘ ’Tis most ungenteel for
a young gentlewoman like you to eat so freely!’
Carrie was a little ashamed of herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You see, madam,’ she explained, ‘I live
always with men, and perhaps their example
has made me eat as they do. I do not think I
shall become very fat, because all my life I
have been hungry, and I have not become fat
yet, you see.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>The restrictions of her aunt’s society began
to press upon Carrie pretty heavily by the afternoon.
All morning she had had to sit indoors
sewing at her embroidery, then, about two
o’clock, she must drive out for a slow airing
until dinner, then came two hours more of talk
and embroidery, and after supper a game of
whist with double-dummy. And outside, while
all these golden hours dragged so slowly past,
was the grand, twittering, budding spring
world waiting to be explored! Carrie beat an
impatient tattoo upon the floor with her little
foot, and answered Lady Mallow’s questions
rather incoherently.</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>The next day was the same, and the next and
the next. On the fourth day, urged by despair,
Carrie sat down to write to Sebastian the
whole tale of her woe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Sir, I shall die,’ she wrote. ‘ ’Tis terrible;
I do not like living with women, I find men
vastly more agreeable. Pray, pray, dear sir—my
dearest dada—write and summon me home,
for I am weary of my life here at Wynford.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sebastian laughed a good deal over this
mournful missive, and wrote Carrie to try to
cultivate patience and the womanly graces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But before his letter had reached her, help
had come to Carrie from an unexpected quarter.
Lady Mallow, by the kindness of Heaven, fell
sick of an influenza, which painful disorder
confined the poor lady to her bed, and set Carrie
at liberty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And <span class='it'>ennui</span> fled: and with happy hurrying
feet Carrie raced down the avenue and along
the sweet hedge-bordered roads, going she knew
not whither—but away, away from bondage
and embroidery and double-dummy whist!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned off into a side lane, and then
stood looking across the country to see which
direction seemed the most promising.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The river plainly beckoned her: so, thrusting
her way through the hedge, Carrie set off across
the meadows towards the silvery loops of water
that slipped along so invitingly in the distance.
The fields were white with anemone blossoms.
She stood among them in perfect rapture, and
then got down upon her knees and began to
pull the flowers in handfuls; then further off,
along the river bank, she saw a great thicket
of blossoming thorn, white as snow, and off she
ran towards it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie flung down all her freshly gathered
flowers in a heap upon the grass when she
reached the thorn bushes. For these blossoms
were lovelier by far than anything she had seen
yet; the little starry flowers set on to their
jagged black stems had a beauty all their own.
Undismayed by the assailing thorns, Carrie
pressed into the thicket to gather some of the
coveted branches. Her hair caught on the
bushes, her dress gave a distracting tear, and
finally she scratched her plump white arm up to
the elbow. This at last sobered her adventurous
spirit. She tried to escape from the
clinging branches, but being town-bred, she
was ignorant of the fact that to turn round in
a thorn thicket is to imprison yourself hopelessly
there. So Carrie twisted quickly round,
thinking to find herself free, and instead felt of
a sudden twenty more thorns catch on her unfortunate
person. She shook her head, and a
branch a-dance in the breeze clutched her hair
like a human hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘O you beautiful cross bushes!’ cried Carrie
in despair, ‘I will not gather more of you, if
you will but let me go!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Can I help you, madam?’ said a voice behind
her at this moment, and some one laughed.
Carrie could not turn round to see who had
come to her assistance, but she laughed also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘O yes, I thank you,’ she cried; ‘I do not
know what to do, I am all caught round and
round.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Come out backwards; do not try to turn,
I shall hold the branches here for you. Take
heed for your eyes, madam,’ said her helper.
Carrie began to beat a slow retreat, disengaging
herself from the clinging branches one by one.
At last, torn and dishevelled, she shook off the
last assailant and turned round to see who had
come to her aid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A young man with very shining eyes stood
beside her, still holding back the thorn bushes
with one hand. They looked at each other in
silence for a moment, and then the young man
exclaimed in a tone of surprised amusement,</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Now, by all the powers! ’Tis little Carrie
Shepley!’ And Carrie, in spite of her ruffled
plumage, responded to this salutation with
great urban ease of manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘And this is “Phil” that used to be?’ she
said, holding out her hand to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Carrie, you are scarce changed at all, saving
that you are grown to be near as tall as I am,’
said Phil, and he eyed Carrie with great admiration
as he took her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Nor you either, Mr.—Mr.—I forget your
surname,’ said Carrie, drawing herself up with
some dignity at this rather free address from a
stranger. But as she spoke she met Phil’s
shining eyes so ridiculously unchanged that she
laughed outright and came down from her high
horse without further delay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You are not Mr. Anything, I think—only
Phil,’ she said. ‘I could think, to look at us
both just now, that we were playing in the
Park, and that Patty and Peter would come
round the corner in a moment to scold us!
Pray, sir—Phil—where are you come from, and
how do we meet here?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Come and sit by the river, and I shall tell
you everything you care to hear,’ said Phil.
And Carrie, nothing loath, sat down on the
bank, gathered her torn flounces around her,
and gave a surreptitious smooth to her straying
locks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Well, I must tell you, you are a trespasser,
Carrie, on my father’s land. But ’twould be
an ungracious way to renew an old friendship
to arrest you—so I let that pass. My father,
if you must know, is Mr. Richard Meadowes of
Fairmeadowes—the house you see far away
there among the trees; that is how I come to
be here.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Do you live always here then?’ asked
Carrie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I? no—I am but come from Oxford for
Easter. I am alone here though just now.
My father is in town.—But you have not yet
told me how you are here, Carrie?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I am visiting my aunt, Lady Mallow. She
hath taken Forde, the house which stands on
the sloping ground about half a mile from here
along the high road. And indeed, indeed,
Phil, I have come near running away to London,
so dull have I been these four days since
I came to Wynford.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Dull—ah, ’tis a terrible thing to be dull,’
said Phil sympathetically; ‘once I was dull—just
once in life, and I made the resolve never
to suffer it again. I can bear to be unhappy,
or even to be in pain; but dulness—never. I’d
sooner get drunk than be dull!’ And at that
the young man went off into a curiously ringing
laugh that sounded across the fields like a
bell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Then are you never dull here?’ asked Carrie
in amazement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘O no—never. I come here once or twice
in the year, and I bring with me books to last
me all the time and more; sometimes I work
hard, hard, till I feel as though my brain would
crack—’tis rather nice that, and then I come
down here by the river and amuse myself; or
I ride, or shoot the crows, or anything else
there is to shoot. But the first morning I
waken at an end of my resources, that day I
leave Wynford. Oh, but I love Fairmeadowes.
I never tire here.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You are just the same,’ said Carrie, more
emphatically than before; ‘to hear you talk—’tis
just as you used to.’ She looked down at
Phil as she spoke. He had flung himself down
on the bank at her feet, and was gazing up at
her in the frankest manner possible. ‘Why,
how old are you?’ she asked suddenly, as unceremonious
as he was, and Phil answered without
a moment’s hesitation, ‘One-and-twenty,
and horribly young it is—but there is all the
world to conquer, to be sure, and only one life
to do it in.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie opened her eyes at this statement.
‘How?’ she inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘How? ah, that is just the question! My
father wished me to enter the Service—not I!
“ ’Tis a profession for gentlemen,” he said.
“Yes, and for fools,” said I, and he (who was
in it himself, though he’s no fool!) was rarely
angry with me. My father, you know, is a
curious man—oh, I shall tell you all that another
time,’ said Phil, rolling over on the bank
in the most childish manner; then he rose and
seated himself beside Carrie. Leaning his chin
on his hand he looked down at the river as it
flowed below them, and went on in a more serious
tone—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I had no mind to enter the Service, you see,
because I must have something to do that I
care about. To speak now before crowds and
crowds of people—that would be my ambition.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘But what would you speak about?’ asked
Carrie laughingly—she was a splendid listener!</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Speak! I’d speak about anything, Carrie.
I’d speak eloquently for half an hour upon your
shoe-strings and my entire unworthiness to unloose
them!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I believe you would,’ laughed Carrie; ‘you
should enter the Church, Phil, then each Lord’s
Day you must speak for a certain time.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Not the Church for me, my imagination is
by far too strong for that; ’twould have me
before my Bishop in a jiffy. Oh, do you remember
how scared you were once when I described
to you how God would come down on
the gilt top of St. Paul’s?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Yes indeed; I should pity your hearers did
you scare them after that fashion,’ said Carrie,
with a smile of reminiscence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I think I shall study for the Bar,’ began
Phil, and then, because in spite of his volubility
he was not a bore, he started up in genuine
dismay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Lord save us!’ he exclaimed; ‘here have
I been talking of my own affairs so long you
will never speak to me again, Carrie. Come,
let me show you the path through the park, and
as you love me, talk of some other matter!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie laughingly obeyed, talking in her turn
of herself, and then they talked of childhood
(that was not so very far behind either of
them), and of Patty and of Peter. (‘He’s
about the only man I respect in this world; if
I could do my duty like him I should be proud,’
said Phil. ‘Why, he has never been late with
my shaving-water for years.’ At this statement
Carrie glanced up with a little grimace of
amusement at Phil’s rather peach-like cheek,
and he laughed ringingly. ‘Well, that is mayhap
something of an exaggeration,’ he admitted.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so they sauntered on, abundantly amused
with each other, till Carrie remembered with
dismay the lateness of the hour, and bidding
Phil a hurried farewell, ran off down the road
in the direction of Forde.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil called after her as she ran: ‘Come
again to-morrow, Carrie.’ And so they parted.</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>It was not the nature of Mr. Philip Meadowes
(as may have been gathered from his talk) to
be reticent upon any subject. He had the
acumen, however, which most talkative persons
lack, to choose his listeners carefully; but with
those whom he trusted Phil had absolutely no
reserves. Chief among his confidants was
Peter, the grave-faced elderly man-servant who
had cuffed his ears in childhood, and now had
discreetly forgotten the fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This evening, as Peter brought in his young
master’s wine, Phil, lying back in a chair, the
book he had been reading thrown carelessly on
the floor, addressed him quite impatiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Why, where have you been all afternoon,
Peter?’ he said.—‘Now whom do you think I
met to-day, by all that is curious?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter laid down the tray he carried, picked
up the book from the floor, smoothed its ruffled
pages, and made a feint of guessing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Mayhap the parson, sir?’ he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘No, no, stupid; more interesting by far!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Mayhap the parson’s daughter, sir?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Wrong again; some one a deuced deal prettier
than the parson’s daughter. But there,
you can never guess—who but Carrie Shepley
that I used to play with long ago in town, in the
days when you were courting her maid Patty?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil expected Peter to laugh at this resurrection
of his former flirtations; but instead of
laughing he stepped forward and laid his hand
suddenly on his young master’s arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘For the love of Heaven, sir, do you have
naught to do with Miss Carrie Shepley!’ he
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil was surprised beyond measure to see the
decorous Peter so startled out of his usual behaviour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Why, Peter, what the dickens is the matter
with you?’ he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘This, sir, that there will be trouble betwixt
you and the master if so be you takes up with
Miss Carrie Shepley. I know not the rights
nor the wrongs of the story, but this I knows,
that there was a mighty quarrel once betwixt
the master and Miss Carrie’s father, Dr. Shepley
of Jermyn Street as is.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Oh—ho!’ whistled Phil. ‘And what did
the gentlemen fall out upon, Peter?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘On a woman, sir,’ said Peter, fidgeting a
little uneasily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘And who was the woman?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘By the name of Anne Champion, as I gathered,
sir. I overheard their quarrel, sir,
through the folding-doors betwixt the rooms in
St. James’ Square, sir.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘So that was why you and Patty were so
particular that we met outside, and altogether—eh,
Peter?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘The same, sir.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Ah, Peter, I have hope for you yet! Sometimes
I think you scarce human, you are so
dutiful and faithful, but you stooped to some
deceit, I’m glad to hear, once, all along of
Patty!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter smiled his demure smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘ ’Twas as you say, sir,—all along of Patty,’
he assented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil reverted then to the quarrel. ‘Anne
Champion, Anne Champion,’ he repeated.
‘And who was Anne Champion, think you,
Peter?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter came up to the fireplace, re-arranged
the ornaments on the mantel-shelf, blew away
a speck of imaginary dust from the gilt top of
the clock, and then, speaking low, he said at
last—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Your mother, sir, if I made no mistake,
sir.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Eh?’ queried Phil, sitting forward in his
chair, becoming suddenly sober.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘The same, sir,’ repeated Peter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘And Shepley and my father fell out over
my mother, by your way of it, then?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘ ’Twas that way for certain, sir.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘And what became of my mother, since you
know so much, Peter?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘How she came by her death, sir, I have no
knowledge, but this I can tell you as the master
knew naught of her death till Shepley told him
the same. I heard them speak it out. Saith
the master, “I shall provide for her,” and saith
Shepley, “She wants for naught,” and saith
the master, “ ’Tis I should support her now,”
and then saith Shepley, “Anne Champion is
dead, and her blood be on you, and on your
children,” and with that he walked out of the
room and through the hall to the street door,
and the whole was over. I made bold to enter
the room, and there sat the master white and
shakin’ like any leaf. “Sir,” says I, “there
hath harm come to you,” but he made little of
it, and bade me fetch him some wine. The
same I did, and set to straighten the room, that
was in a disorder such as never was. The
master watched me a minute, and then saith
he, “Can you be silent on this, Peter—no word
of it to any in the house?” and with that what
think you he did, sir? The most of gentlemen
would have offered me money; the master he
held out his hand to me like any other man.
I’ve been silent on it all these years, sir, for
that handshake.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil had been listening breathlessly, his quick
wits piecing together from Peter’s rather incoherent
account some skeleton of the truth.
But at this point he fairly laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘The devil he did!’ he said. ‘Now, was
not that like him, Peter? Ah, you are a clever
man, my good father!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter smiled indulgently. ‘Now, sir, you
do never give the master his due, if I may make
bold to say so,’ he began. ‘But to finish with
the story, sir. ’Twas not more than six weeks
from then that you was brought to the house,
sir, and that’s all I do know—but, sir, from it
you’ll see how ’twould be if you took up with
Miss Carrie Shepley.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Well, Peter, if the case be so serious as you
say, you and Patty should have hesitated ere
you introduced us,’ said Phil mischievously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Sir, sir, this is no laughing matter,’ said
Peter in a sad tone, for Phil, with the incurable
flippancy that characterised him, had burst into
a peal of laughter at the man’s grave face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Peter, you are a Methodist; pour me out
my wine and go; there is no calculating what
will come to me “all along of Carrie,” ’ he
said. But when Peter had gone Phil rose and
stood looking into the glass that hung on the
wall, while he examined his features with a
new interest. ‘Anne Champion,’ he repeated.
And as, for the first time, he uttered his mother’s
name a curious thrill passed through him.
‘Poor mother of mine,’ he said, ‘I hope I have
more of you in me than of Richard Meadowes.’</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>‘Satan,’ says Dr. Watts, ‘finds mischief for
idle hands to do.’ And Caroline Shepley, being
very idle at Wynford, fell into mischief in a
way which would have confirmed good Dr.
Watts in his convictions. Lady Mallow’s influenza,
by dint of coddling, had become very
severe indeed, and Carrie was left quite to her
own devices. What these were the readers
who have followed this story so far will have
little difficulty in guessing. Day after day
Philip and Carrie met each other, and their acquaintance
deepened and ripened with extraordinary
rapidity. They seemed to have none of
the preliminaries of friendship to go through,
but to have arrived suddenly at intimacy. Carrie
was no great letter-writer at any time, now
all thoughts of writing had long ago left her;
she had not put pen to paper for three weeks—so
absorbing an interest is flirtation. The
weather hitherto had been very fine, but at last
one morning broke wet and grey. Carrie
was sick at heart; how could she meet Philip
out of doors on such a day? she asked herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now dwellers in town may dread a wet day,
yet they can scarcely dread it with that entire
dismay of heart that falls upon the country
dweller at sight of the blank grey heavens, the
spongy roads, the dripping trees. The pleasures
of the country are, in fact, entirely visionary
in wet weather, its discomforts really practical.
Carrie stood and looked out over the fields, yesterday
so green, to-day so grey; up at the
skies, yesterday so blue, to-day so leaden, and
her heart died within her. What on earth
should she do with herself all day? She went
up-stairs and tried to be sympathetic over her
aunt’s symptoms for an hour or more, then she
came down-stairs again and worked at her embroidery,
then she tried to read (Carrie was not
intellectual, you remember), then she fell asleep
and wakened to hear the dinner-bell ring, always
a welcome summons to this hearty young
heroine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dinner over, Carrie went again to inquire for
the health of Lady Mallow, and as she stood
beside the bed, listening with ill-concealed
yawns to an enumeration of all the symptoms,
Carrie became aware of a sudden lightening of
the leaden skies, and a watery sunbeam shot in
at the window. She could have clapped her
hands for joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Now, Caroline,’ said Lady Mallow, ‘here
is the <span class='it'>Gentlewoman’s Journal</span>, which contains
much useful information, such as may be useful
to you in after life. I commend to your attention
the article which relates to the making of
wax-flowers, a most pretty accomplishment,
and one which, along with other feminine parts
of education, I fear your good father hath omitted
from your course of study,’ etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie listened with very scant attention, but
she took the Journal and made her escape from
the room quickly enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There could be no doubt about it—the sun
was trying to shine. It is true everything was
dripping with moisture, but what of that?
Carrie donned a long blue cloak, slipped a loose
blue hood over her curls, and set off down the
avenue without a thought. It must be confessed
that a hope came to her that Phil too
might be tempted out by this change in the
weather. Nor was Carrie mistaken, for she
had not gone very far along the roads—very
miry they were—before she heard some one
whistling gaily in the distance, and then Phil
came across one of the fields, leaped the fence,
and stood beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Now, how delightful, Carrie!’ he began;
‘I was just wondering how best I could meet
you. ’Twas bold of you to venture out in such
weather, but you have your reward, you see,’
added this saucy young man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘If you but knew the day I have passed!’
cried Carrie. ‘Come, Phil, take me to walk
somewhere; I am near stifled with sitting in
my aunt’s chamber listening to her symptoms
and reading the <span class='it'>Gentlewoman’s Journal</span>.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘We had best keep on the road, then; the
fields are heavy walking to-day,’ said Phil, and
they stepped out along the road very well
pleased with each other. It struck Carrie,
however, that her companion scarcely looked
so cheerful as he had done the day before;
perhaps this dull weather affected his spirits,
she thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Tell me, what is your father like?’ asked
Phil suddenly. Carrie was rather surprised,
but she answered with eager pride:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Tall above the common, and with eyes as
blue as mine; and every one depends on him:
half London come to him to be cured.’ Phil
walked along in silence for a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘What is the matter?’ asked Carrie; ‘you
seem quiet to-day.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I was thinking—thinking of my father,’
said Phil, then turning towards her with his
sudden impulsive manner he burst out, ‘ ’Twould
be strange to feel after that fashion for one’s
father! I’ll tell you what my father is; I am
so like him I can see—yes, see—straight into
his mind, and I know every thought that passes
through it. All my life I’ve lived with him,
and had everything from his hand, and for the
life of me, Carrie, I cannot trust him!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Oh, Phil, have a care what you say!’ exclaimed
Carrie, but Phil, fairly driven on by
the current of his words, continued without
heeding her—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Ninety-nine times he’d bless you, the hundredth
time he’d curse you; his kindness,
when he chooses, can’t be known, and when it
comes to an end he’s as hard as these flints.
Oh, but he is not bad through and through
either, only like a rotten fruit—one bite so good
and the next all gone to corruption. I sometimes
look and look at him and wonder how
’twill end—the good or the bad. I’d like to
have a bet on him, I’d back the devil in him
though, and I’d win. And for all this, Carrie,
when he talks to me, as he will sometimes for
hours, ’tis all I can do not to worship him. He
understands me full as well as I understand
him, that’s the strange thing, and he knows I
know his heart. When I look at him and
think about myself, I think sometimes that I
am doomed to perdition. I’ll go his way, only
quicker, and that’s the way that leads——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>All of a sudden Phil stopped, pointing down
to the ground ominously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘No,’ said Carrie; ‘for your eyes are open.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘That’s the way my father has gone; you
don’t suppose he sins with his eyes shut,’ said
Phil. ‘He told me once (he’s nothing if not
frank) that——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Round the corner of the road came a sudden
sound of wheels, a jingle of harness, a plash of
many horses’ feet through the mire. Carrie
glanced up to see a coach with outriders approaching;
the men wore prune liveries, and
at sight of them Phil stood still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘<span class='it'>My father, Carrie</span>,’ he said, and Carrie
marvelled at his tense voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Splish-splash through the sparking mud came
the horses, each with his jogging postilion
a-back, whipping and spurring and cursing by
turns, for the roads were heavy and the horses
weary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil and Carrie stood to the side, and Carrie
took a curious glance into the coach, where a
man sat, its only occupant. The next moment
the coach had drawn up beside them, and the
man, opening the door, stepped out on to the
road, and bowed low before Carrie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I scarce expected to find my son in such
fair company, madam,’ he said, but with a
little interrogative lift of his eyebrows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil’s face flushed, but he answered in a
clear, steady voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Sir, may I have the honour to present to
you Miss Caroline Shepley? It has been my
good fortune to make Miss Shepley’s acquaintance
since coming to Wynford.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Good fortune indeed,’ said Richard Meadowes,
though the name went through him like
a stab. Nemesis, Nemesis!—what was this?
A woman in a blue hood stood before him, who
wore the very features of Sebastian Shepley,
and did he dream that Philip called her by that
name?</p>

<p class='pindent'>A good thing it is we do not see into men’s
hearts as we look into their faces! Carrie, as
she stood all unconscious by the roadside in her
blue hood, saw in Richard Meadowes only an
elderly man, alert-looking, and of courteous
address, who smiled on her with such a singularly
pleasant and interesting smile that at once
she wished to see him smile again. To this
end she smiled herself, and with a gesture towards
Phil, she said very sweetly—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘The fortune hath not been altogether on his
side, sir, for indeed I should have fared ill at
Wynford without your son’s society.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Phil should know better than to ask a lady
to walk out over such roads as these,’ said
Meadowes, with a glance at Carrie’s shoes;
for that careless young woman, who was very
vain of her pretty feet, had come out in a pair
of smart high-heeled satin shoes—now, alas!
smart no longer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Oh, we are not come so very far from
home,’ said Carrie; ‘but, sir, Phil will wish
to ride home with you. I shall not go farther
now.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You must allow me to have the honour of
fetching you home in the coach,’ said Meadowes.
He offered his hand to Carrie, and held
open the door of the coach as he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie considered it very good fun to ride
home in a coach and four. She thought what
fun she would make of it in her next letter to
her father. But she noticed how silent Phil
had become of a sudden. He sat on the back
seat and allowed his father to carry on all the
conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the gate of Lady Mallow’s house Carrie
descended, and, with a farewell wave of her
hand, tripped off up the avenue in her damp
little shoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Carrie had left the coach all efforts at
conversation ceased entirely between father and
son. But when they drew up at the door,
Meadowes, as he got out, signified to Phil that
he would speak with him at once in the library.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil followed his father with a shrug which
was not noticed by the older man, as he seated
himself in a large chair, and indicated to Phil
that he should stand facing him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Where did you meet Miss Caroline Shepley?’
was the first suavely put question which
Phil had to answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘In the fields by the river, sir.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘And what introduction had you to this fair
lady?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I had met her before, sir.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Where?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘In London.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘At whose house in London?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘In the Park.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘And who presented you to her there?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘A friend, sir.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘What friend?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I cannot tell you, sir.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You must tell me.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I will not.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a short silence. Phil leant against
the mantel-shelf looking straight at his father,
and waited for him to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meadowes folded his arms, unfolded them,
leant back in his chair, finally spoke—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Well, that is straight speech, my son, and
mine shall be as straight: After this time you
shall not with my permission have word or
look again for Miss Caroline Shepley.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Have you aught against Carrie Shepley,
sir?’ asked Phil. He burned to tell his father
all he knew, but the dread of bringing Peter
into disgrace tied his tongue—he must try to
extract the story for himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I have: let that suffice you. Philip,’ cried
his father, starting forward in his seat, ‘Philip,
you are too young to question my commands
after this fashion. Enough that I tell you to
have no further speech with this young woman.
’Tis not for you to gainsay me.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil drew himself up quickly from the easy
lounging attitude he had stood in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Sir,’ he said, ‘speak with Carrie? I will
speak with her, yes, and court her, yes, and
marry her—that I’ll do if Heaven so send that
she’ll have me.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘On how long acquaintance have you taken
this resolve?’ asked his father dryly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Three weeks, sir.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Ah, long enough assuredly for so unimportant
a step to be considered!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil was too acute not to see that his adversary
had scored here. He had, moreover, a
trait of age seldom to be noticed in the young:
he could laugh at his own foibles. He laughed
now, well amused at his ardour, and, dropping
lightly on his knees beside his father’s chair,
took Meadowes’ long white hand in his with
his sudden irresistible impetuosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Sir, will you not tell me the story of your
heart?’ he said. ‘Sure every man alive hath
felt as I feel now!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘My heart! ’twould be a history indeed,’
said Meadowes. He spoke uneasily, for he had
reached that stage of moral decay which refuses
to answer any serious questioning. With a
quick shuffle of the conversational cards he
passed on:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘A history indeed.—But to return to the subject
in hand from which you try to escape: you
have known Caroline Shepley for three weeks;
you wish to marry her; I do not intend that
you should; therefore there the case stands.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil had risen and stood before his father
again. There is nothing more irritating to the
finer feelings than to have questions, which we
put in all seriousness, answered lightly. Phil
had for a moment thought he might gain his
father’s confidence, but he had been mistaken.
He felt jarred and baffled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I am sorry, sir. I shall take my own way,’
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Then I shall have no more to do with you,
Philip.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Then I shall have to provide for myself.
You have at least given me brains enough for
that,’ said Phil hotly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Do you think so? Well, brains are a good
gift, better perhaps than gold.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil stared at his father for a moment in
blank amazement, then he turned on his heel
and left the room without a word.</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER XX</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>After Philip had gone, Richard Meadowes
leaned back in his chair with closed eyes for a
long time. The past was stirred in him by this
quarrel. In the twenty years that had elapsed
since Anne Champion’s death he had changed
very little outwardly; but the soul had travelled
a long road these twenty years. Now
looking back over the ‘Past’s enormous disarray’
he scarcely recognised himself for the
same man he had been. He that had started
so eagerly in the race, how he lagged now!
he had not an enthusiasm left, and smiled to
remember all he used to have. At one time
too he remembered having thought about things
spiritual; these did not visit him now. Once
even he had feared death and judgment; death
now-a-days had ceased to appall him, and for
judgment he thought of it as an old-world
fable. He could even think of Anne Champion’s
sad story and her cruel end with no more
than a momentary pang of discomfort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But for all this the soul was still partially
alive in this man. He could still suffer, and
that is a sign of vitality, and if he had a genuine
sentiment left it was for his son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His suffering indeed was of a purely egotistical
sort. The vast failure he had made of life
struck a sort of cold despair through him; Phil
must make restitution for his failures; and
now the coldest thought of all assailed him: he
had not Phil’s heart. He had lavished kindness
on the boy all his life, yet sometimes Phil
would look at him in his curiously expressive
fashion and turn away quickly as if to hide the
thought that leapt out from his speaking eyes:
‘I know you, I understand you.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>But whether Phil loved him or not, thought
he, he could not afford to quarrel with him
after this fashion. Everything else in life had
failed; Phil at least he must keep!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meadowes rose hurriedly and went in search
of Phil, who had gone out, it appeared, across
the Park.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun had come out now, after the rain,
and its warmth drew up the smell of the mould
from the streaming moisture-laden earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Earth, where I shall soon lie,’ thought
Meadowes; ‘earth, that will absorb me into
its elements again. Then the great failure will
be at an end, the puzzle solved—no, not solved,
only concluded: solved would mean another
life, and that would mean—— Ah! the opened
Books, and the Face from which earth and
heaven flee away, and the Voice crying:
“<span class='it'>Give an account of thy stewardship, for thou
mayest be no longer steward.</span>” Tush, why does
that old nonsense so ring in the brain?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Phil, Phil,’ he shouted; he could stand his
own thoughts no longer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is always a difficult matter to retract one’s
words. But it was a characteristic of Richard
Meadowes that he could generally extricate
himself from any difficult situation with grace
and composure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was, he admitted, quite unsuitable that,
after having fairly warned Phil of the results
of his disobedience, he should now retract all
he had just said; but it must be done. Phil
must stay with him at any cost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, putting the best face he could to it, he
called and called again for Philip, who at last
appeared: he had quite expected the summons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I suppose he desires to forget all that has
just passed,’ thought Phil, well aware of the
sway he held over his father’s affections.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I think you called me, sir?’ he said. He
wore a very demure aspect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Yes; I wished to explain this matter further,
Phil: ’twas perhaps scarcely fair in me
not to give you a reason for my displeasure.
Let us walk on and I shall tell you all.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it would, alas, have been as impossible
for the Richard Meadowes of now-a-days to tell
all the truth about any subject as it would be
for a crab to discontinue the sidelong gait
which is its inheritance; so he cut out one half
of the story and padded up the other half, and
summed up the whole in one easy sentence:
‘ ’Twas, in fact, jealousy on Shepley’s part
caused our quarrel,’ he said—a half-truth which
altered the facts of the case a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Who was the woman?’ asked Philip bluntly.
‘I suppose she was my mother?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Yes, Anne Champion by name,’ Meadowes
said, but hurried on before Phil had time to
question him further. ‘So you can see, Philip,
that I have reason on my side when I bid you
have no more to do with Miss Caroline Shepley.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I scarce see why an old quarrel between our
parents should come between us,’ said Phil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘My dear Phil,’ said the candid father, ‘I
will be frank with you—’tis an old story, and I,
for my part, would willingly bury it; but I
know Shepley for a man of vindictive passions,
and I tell you this, that no power on earth
would persuade him to give you his daughter’s
hand in marriage. ’Twill spare you perhaps
much pain and unpleasantness with him if you
but take my advice and see no more of the girl.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil shook his head. But light had meantime
come to Meadowes. He would make
peace with Phil yet—all would be well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Well, Phil,’ he said, ‘I have told you the
truth of how the matter stands, and how prudence
should guide you; but moreover I have
considered what I said to you in haste, and
even should you persist in this folly I will not
turn you from your home.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then with a sudden genuine impulse of feeling
he laid his hand on Phil’s arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Phil, Phil, you are all that I have—you
must stay with me were a hundred Carrie Shepleys
in the case.’ Phil did not speak, but he
took his father’s hand, bowing over it with the
elaborate courtesy of the age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I can only ask you, give this matter your
very careful consideration,’ said his father, and
with that he turned the conversation into another
channel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a few hours later—when the dusk had
fallen, a man on horseback left Fairmeadowes
bearing a special and important missive to Dr.
Sebastian Shepley of London. The horseman
had orders to spend as little time on the road
as might be, and the letter ran thus:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>‘<span class='sc'>Sebastian Shepley</span>,—Richard Meadowes
must acquaint you with the fact that, unless
you take prompt measures for the removal of
your daughter from the house of her aunt Lady
Mallow, she will undoubtedly contract a marriage
with the son of that man who has the
honour to sign himself</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:9em;'>‘<span class='sc'>Your Enemy</span>.’</p>

</div>

<div><h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie—unconscious, sleepy Carrie—laid herself
down to rest that night in her four-post
bed, and slept the dreamless sleep of youth and
health, till the morning light stealing through
the curtains disturbed her a little, when she
dreamt she was riding down Piccadilly in a
coach and four with Philip Meadowes, and
wakened with a laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And all this night, that had passed so quickly
for Carrie, a man was spurring along the miry
roads towards London, bearing a letter that
was big with fate for her; while at Fairmeadowes
Phil tossed about, revolving something in
his mind that did not seem to take shape very
easily; and Richard Meadowes too lay sleepless
till the dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three sleepless men, ‘all along of Carrie,’ as
Phil had so vulgarly put it!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cause of Phil’s sleeplessness was not
far to seek, for, late that night, Peter had
brought him a curious and disquieting piece of
news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘The master hath sent George a-ridin’ express
to town this night, sir,’ he had said, and
then, in a whisper, ‘bearing a letter, sir, with
the address “<span class='it'>To Dr. Sebastian Shepley</span>.” For
George is no scholar, and came to me to read
the direction, sir, and there it was, so sure as I
do stand in my shoes.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil, who was not without youthful affectations,
pretended to receive this intelligence with
great unconcern; but when Peter had gone he
strode up and down the room in great agitation.
Then he threw up the window, and leant
out into the velvety spring darkness. Thoughts
throbbed through his brain that the cool night
air could do very little to calm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘By Heaven!’ he said, speaking out into the
darkness, ‘he’ll not outwit me.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>So this was what his father’s sudden change
of front had meant!—he wished to throw the
blame upon Dr. Shepley if Carrie was taken
away. Oh ho, that was very wily no doubt,
‘but not all the fathers in Britain shall outwit
me,’ said the arrogant Philip, and began to
revolve schemes in his busy, clever young
head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Towards morning he turned over on his pillow,
and fell to sleep at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I can but try my luck,’ he murmured as his
eyes closed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The spring world was all a-dazzle with sunshine
again after yesterday’s rain, when Carrie
came down-stairs. I regret to say that she
came down-stairs late, bidding the maid ‘not
tell Lady Mallow’ with such a charming smile
that the austere elderly woman fibbed profusely
to her mistress a few minutes later. After
breakfast, Carrie went out on to the lawn, and
stood, in apparent irresolution, looking round
her. She smiled to herself out of mere pleasure
of heart, and strolled away down the steps to
the terrace, following her errant fancies. From
the terrace there was a wide view far over the
country. Carrie stood still here, shaded her
eyes from the brilliant sunshine, and gazed intently
in the direction of Fairmeadowes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Far away among the fields she saw some one
walking by the river bank. Carrie was irresolute
no longer. She did not stay to put on her
hat and her gloves, nor stop to consider that
she had not yet visited her aunt’s sick-room—no,
she did none of these things, but ran off
down the avenue, and, pushing through the
hedge, walked with more sedateness across the
fields. In the distance, now, she could hear a
long clear whistle like a bird’s note. It came
nearer and nearer, then Phil came up through
the long, reedy, flowering grasses by the riverside,
with both hands held out to her; his
shining eyes seemed to speak for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I thought you were never coming, Carrie,’
he said, and took her hands in his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitherto their relations had been strictly unsentimental,
now they had suddenly become
lovers; without a word of explanation they
both acknowledged it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Come and sit down, Carrie, I have all the
world to say to you,’ said Phil, and he flung
his arm round her as he spoke. To Carrie it
seemed the most natural thing that Phil should
be in love with her—she had known it indeed
for ten days past—she was not the least surprised
at it, but what did surprise her now was
to find that she too was in love, and that it
was so natural—she seemed to have loved Phil
always. It was no astonishing thing to her
that she should sit here with Phil’s arm round
her, and hear him say all manner of things that
only yesterday he would never have dreamed
of saying. What did astonish her was that he
had not said all this long ago! Why not yesterday?
why not when they first met? Had
they ever been strangers? Had they not understood
each other always? It was ridiculous
this sudden assumption of loverishness on Phil’s
part; they had been lovers from long long
ago!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And from these happy thoughts Carrie was
rudely wakened by what Phil was saying. His
voice was urgent, his looks were anxious; he
was actually telling her a story, in rather incoherent
words, about both their parents, and
a woman and a fight, and she did not take it
all in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘But what has all this to do with you and
with me, Phil?’ she asked, raising her face to
his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil turned and shook her ever so lightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Oh, you dear dull darling that you are,’ he
cried; ‘do you not see they will separate us?—take
you away from me, Carrie—never allow
you to see me again?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘But I could not live without you,’ said simple
Carrie, unaware that the formula had been
used before; it seemed quite an original argument
to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Nor I without you, of course,’ cried Phil—quite
as unoriginal, in spite of his quick wits
(the poor and the rich in wits as in wealth meet
together in some things), ‘and for that reason
you won’t refuse me what I ask, Carrie—’tis
the only plan—I’ve thought all the matter out,
and unless you will do it, your father will be
here to-night, and will carry you off to London,
and you will never see my face again, as like
as not.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Well?’ asked Carrie dubiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You’ll run away with me, and marry me.
’Tis as easy as the alphabet if once we get to
London.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Oh, but my father,’ protested Carrie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Well, it has come to this: you must choose
betwixt him and me; he will never allow you
to marry me if he knows.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘But ’tis so sudden, Phil!—if I had even a
day to consider the matter.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You have scarce an hour,’ said Phil; ‘by
now your father has that letter, by another
hour, if I mistake not, he will be on his way
here; by the evening he will have arrived.
You must come with me now, now, now—or——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>The unspoken alternative of separation struck
coldly on Carrie’s ear. Yet another love,
older, steadier, plucked at her heart—she was
torn between the two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Ah, Phil,’ she cried, ‘I cannot leave you,
and I cannot grieve my father. What am I to
do? O what a sad thing trouble is—I have
never known it before!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>(I doubt if she ever had.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil was not, perhaps, as diligent a Biblical
student as he might have been, but his researches
in that direction came to his aid at this
moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Oh, you know, Carrie, there is Scripture
for that,’ he said, ‘about “leaving father and
mother and cleaving to your wife”—that’s the
rule for men, and I dare swear it holds good
for women too.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Do you think so? But I would not grieve
my father for the world,’ hesitated Carrie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil grew impatient, for time was racing on,
the sun was high in the heavens now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You must—you must; can you bear to
think of never seeing me again? I’d sooner
miss the sun out of the sky than you, Carrie.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie seemed to herself to be whirled round
and round in the eddies of Phil’s passion; she
could not gainsay him, and yet she trembled
and held back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Yes—ah, yes—I would go to the world’s
end with you, Phil,’ she said, ‘if it were not
for fear to grieve my father.’ She rose and
paced up and down the bank in an agony of indecision,
clasping her hands together and then
flinging them out with a gesture of helpless bewilderment.
Never in life before had Carrie
been called upon to make a decision of any importance,
and now the two strongest affections
of her heart warred together for the victory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil came and paced beside her, arguing, beseeching,
coaxing her by turns—till she turned
at last in despair and laid her hands in his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I will come with you,’ she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil did not allow the grass to grow under
his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Come then, so quickly as you can, Carrie,’
he cried, ‘for each moment is precious. I shall
return to Fairmeadowes and tell them I am
gone out for the day. You must go home and
put on your habit, and get one of your good
aunt’s horses.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I am not permitted to ride alone,’ said Carrie,
who saw lions in the way at every turn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil laughed, and put his hand in his pocket.
‘Here, Carrie,’ he said, ‘give me your hand.’
Carrie all unsuspicious laid her hand in his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘That is what you must do to your aunt’s
groom, my child; there never was groom yet
but understood that argument,’ said Phil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘All this, Phil?’ said Carrie, as she eyed
the yellow coin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘All that, and say, as you give it, that he
must come to Wyntown for the horse at five o’
the clock.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘But he will wonder, Phil.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Doubtless.—Oh, Carrie, but women waste
time on trifles!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie was nettled by this remark, so she
hastened off as fast as she could through the
long meadow hay, determined that Phil should
not find her so dilatory after all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Meet me at the cross roads,’ Phil shouted,
as he ran off in the direction of Fairmeadowes.</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>Philip, who knew every step of the road between
Wynford and London, had some very
disquieting thoughts as he rode down to the
cross roads to meet Carrie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everything depended upon whether they
could reach the half-way house at Wyntown
before Dr. Shepley. For after Wyntown there
were several roads which each led to town;
but between Wynford and Wyntown there was
only one road. Therefore if they met, they
would in all probability meet upon that road.
Phil determined to keep his fears to himself.
It was a pleasant morning, and a pleasant ride.
He found Carrie already waiting for him under
the flickering shade of the beech-trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You see I can make haste when I please,
sir,’ she said, trying to smile. The smile, however,
was rather forced, and after a few ineffectual
attempts at conversation they rode along
in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘The deuce take that horse of your aunt’s!’
at last quoth Phil in despair; ‘can you not
make him go a better pace, Carrie?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie smiled, and shook her head. ‘My
aunt will never permit her steeds to go beyond
a slow trot,’ she explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Oh, your aunt be ——,’ began Phil, and
Carrie actually laughed outright at his irritation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Now you resemble a little boy I once knew
who used bad words,’ she said, looking up at
him under her eyelashes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I ask your pardon, Carrie; ’tis that old
cow you are riding irritates me,’ he said, with
an impatient flick of his riding-whip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil affected more assurance than he felt,
however, as they dismounted before the door
of the inn at Wyntown. ‘Heaven send Shepley
is not here before us!’ he thought as he
lifted Carrie down and gave the horses to the
ostler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘We shall come up-stairs and dine, Carrie,’
he said. ‘Do you not feel as though you were
my wife already?’ He drew Carrie’s rather
limp little hand through his arm as he spoke,
and they went up-stairs to the inn parlour,
which overlooked the courtyard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You are wearied, I fear, Carrie,’ he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Hot wearied, Phil, in the least, but not
very happy,’ said Carrie, with a stifled sob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil affected deafness, and requested the
landlady to bring up dinner as quickly as might
be. ‘For I am near famished with the morning
air, Mistress Heathe,’ said he, with a smile
to the good woman, an old acquaintance, ‘and
so is this lady also; but she is somewhat weary,
so see no stranger comes in while we are
here.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Just as you please, sir; just as you please,’
said Mistress Heathe, as she bustled round the
table, and made bold to ask for his father’s
health.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘The same I did serve with a bottle of wine
yesterday at this very hour. “Bad roads they
are to-day, Mistress Heathe,” said he, for your
father, sir, is ever so affable in the passing by,
’tis a pleasure serving such gentry as he, to be
sure.’ And she gave a curious squint at Carrie
meanwhile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That young woman made a show of eating a
little, but in truth it was Phil who cleared off
the viands, and Lady Mallow would have been
quite pleased by the genteel appetite of her
niece, if she could have seen how she toyed
with a scrap of chicken, and shook her head at
sight of an apple tart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I am sorry, Phil, I cannot eat,’ she said,
‘and somehow I cannot talk either, so perhaps
we had best not try to talk.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Never fear, Carrie; ’twill be all right
soon,’ said Phil, and he crossed over to the
window and sat there looking out into the yard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wyntown was nearly equidistant between
London and Wynford, so, calculating that Dr.
Shepley had left town at the same hour as they
had left Wynford, he must arrive at Wyntown
not much later than themselves—so calculated
Philip. He had no real reason to suppose that
Dr. Shepley would come at all; everything
depended on the contents of that letter, but if
he did——</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a rumble of wheels over the cobble-paved
courtyard, and Phil saw a very tall
grave-faced man jump down from the seat of a
post-chaise and come up to the door. Carrie,
at the sound of the wheels, came to the window.
She laid her hand on Phil’s shoulder, and
glanced out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Phil! Phil!’ she cried, ‘ ’tis my dear
father.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the one glance she had got of his face Carrie
marked there a new stamp of anxiety she
had never seen before—and it was she who had
stamped it there! She turned away and buried
her face on the cushions of the settle. Phil,
trying to be hard-hearted, affected no sympathy
with her grief, but when at last there came a
succession of quick gasping sobs, he crossed the
room and bent over her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Come, Carrie, you must not grieve so,’ he
said rather lamely. Carrie sat up and dried
her pretty eyes, that were all reddened with
tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘O Phil,’ she said, with a little choke in her
voice, ‘I have never seen him look thus. Ah,
I must see him—speak with him—I shall explain!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose and hurried to the door, but Phil
barred her exit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘ ’Tis madness, Carrie—sheer madness this,’
he expostulated; ‘you’ll never see my face
again if Dr. Shepley discovers you here with
me.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I cannot help it. Ah, Phil, do not be
cruel! See him I must—then I shall go with
you—then we will be married.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You are a fool, Carrie!’ cried Phil, carried
away by one of his sudden, hot fits of temper.
‘ “Then we will be married!”—do you suppose
for one moment your father would permit our
marriage?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Yes,’ said Carrie, ‘I think he would.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Then you think nonsense.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I know him better than you do, Phil.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Well, explain me this then—if so be he will
not oppose our marriage, why doth he hasten
from London at first hint of your meeting me?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘He could not forbid it did he understand all
I shall tell him; ’twould not be like my father
to do so. Phil, you do not know him. You do
not guess even at his generous heart—you——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Generous!’ laughed Phil; ‘no, no, not so
generous as that.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Phil, I shall see him—whatever you say,
I shall see him!’ cried Carrie, and she tried
once more to escape towards the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Phil, fairly mastered now by his temper,
flung the door wide open, crying out: ‘Go to
him then, if you love him the best.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment later he saw Carrie swirl down
the narrow panelled passage of the inn into the
very arms of Sebastian, who had appeared at
the far end of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Lord, Carrie!’ he heard Sebastian exclaim,
as he laughed his jolly whole-hearted laugh and
kissed his daughter on either cheek with more
fervour than gentility. Then there was an incoherent
murmur of exclamation and sobs from
Carrie, then Sebastian’s voice again:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘And how are you here, my girl? Have
you run away from her Ladyship and the influenza?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Yes, sir—with Philip Meadowes, sir,’ said
Carrie, whose downright nature equalled her
father’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil held his breath to hear what Sebastian
would reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘And where is Philip Meadowes?’ he heard
Sebastian say. A minute later Carrie came
into the parlour, leading her father by the
hand. There fell a moment of ominous silence.
Neither of the men spoke, but Carrie, as she
took a hand of each, and looked from one to
the other in puzzled, pretty confusion, was the
first to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘This is Philip, sir,’ she said; ‘and indeed
I am sure you cannot choose but love him.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘There may be two opinions on that point
mayhap,’ said Sebastian grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For all the antagonism of their mutual relations
at the moment, Phil, with his extraordinarily
sensitive nature, felt a sudden impulse
of liking to this man, Carrie’s father. ‘Why
have I not a father like that?’ he thought—‘some
one to rely on without a shadow of distrust.’
Poor Philip, for all his charm, was
sadly alone in the difficult places of life, and
youth, in spite of all its self-assertion, is conscious
enough of its own need. Beside this
resolute masterful man, Phil felt himself, of a
sudden, boyish and foolish, as he had never
felt before. But, assuming a great deal more
self-confidence than he felt, he bowed to Dr.
Shepley and ‘feared the circumstances of their
meeting would scarce conduce to an agreeable
acquaintance between them.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>The older man did not reply to this remark;
but drew back the window-curtain so that the
light might fall full across Phil’s face, and
gazed intently at him for a few moments.
Annie’s son! Flesh of her flesh, bone of her
bone—and Annie cold in her grave these twenty
years! How say some among us that there is
no resurrection? This is, instead, a world of
resurrections, in which that man or woman is
fortunate who can succeed in burying the past
so deep that it cannot rise. Phil and Carrie,
hot with their own impatient young desires,
were only irritated by Sebastian’s silence. How
could they guess at that blinding back-flash of
memory that held him silent at sight of Phil?
How could they hear the voice Sebastian heard—an
urgent tearful voice, ‘<span class='it'>Phil, that hath gotten
half my soul</span>’; and again, ‘<span class='it'>If ever you can
help Phil you’ll do it, because I gave him half
my soul</span>,’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ‘<span class='it'>God give Phil a
white heart</span>,’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ‘<span class='it'>Come, Sebastian?</span>’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Sir, sir, speak!’ cried Carrie, catching hold
again of her father’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the touch of her hand, at the sound of
her voice, Sebastian came back to the present—the
important present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘By Heaven!’ he cried. ‘Once in life is
enough to be robbed by Richard Meadowes!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘But, sir, I am not Richard Meadowes,’ said
Phil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘His son; and twice accursed by that token.
Never shall daughter of mine have my consent
to marry with son of his—black-hearted lying
devil that he is.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie shrank back, scared at her father’s
violence; she had never heard him speak like
this before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Perhaps, sir, ’twould be better for you and
me to discuss this matter by ourselves,’ suggested
Phil. There had, in fact, been no explanation
given on either side as yet, a fact
which Phil was the first to realise. Sebastian,
beside himself with anger, at the sight of Carrie
in company with the son of his enemy, had
never stopped to ask any questions one way or
other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘There is little to discuss, I know, Mr. Meadowes,’
he said. ‘I have information this very
day of your intentions, sent me by your father,
and these intentions I cannot even discuss with
you; I cannot give you my daughter. Even
had you asked her hand of me in a fair and
honourable manner, I would have denied it.
Now doubly I do so since you thought to obtain
it by stealth—a coward’s trick, that savours
of the man you have the honour to name your
father.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie, who knew the hot temper of her
lover, held her breath for fear. But Phil did
not fly into a sudden passion. He looked
Sebastian full in the face, but though he flushed
with anger, his words were quiet enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Did I not know the bitter provocation
which makes you speak so, I would not stand
here and listen to you in silence,’ he said. ‘My
father may be all that you say, sir, but’—here
Phil hesitated for a breath—‘he is all the
father I have, and moreover has been a kind
parent enough to me, as the world counts kindness.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘There—the boy speaks rightly,’ said Sebastian.
‘My words were perhaps over hasty;
but the larger fact of our quarrel remains—that
you have induced my daughter to leave her
home with you, instead of honestly asking her
hand from me.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I knew, as you have indeed just told me,
that that would be wasted breath; ’twas the
only thing left me to do; now Carrie hath
spoilt it all, and I suppose she means to return
with you,’ said Phil, his anger redoubled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I presume that to be her intention,’ said
Sebastian, turning to Carrie as he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Sir, dearest sir, I must do as you command
me now,’ said Carrie. ‘But’—and here she
laid her hand in Phil’s—‘some day I must go
with Phil, for he hath all my heart.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘When you are old enough to take your own
will against mine?’ asked Sebastian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Yes, sir.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘When that day comes, you choose betwixt
him and me.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘If so be I must make the choice,’ said Carrie,
‘I must choose Phil; I cannot, cannot
forsake him.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>There fell a short silence, then Philip spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You must admit, sir,’ he said, ‘ ’tis hard
that Carrie and I should be parted by reason of
your and my father’s old quarrels. But I, in
my turn, must admit I did wrong to make her
leave home with me as I did—for that I must
ask your forgiveness, but, as I live, sir, I swear
you’d have done the same at my age!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was scarcely possible for Phil to harp very
long on the serious string; inevitably his buoyant
nature resented the restraint it was under,
and broke through it. Frustrated, disappointed,
angry, on the eve of being parted from
Carrie, he must still find something to laugh
at. And Sebastian, in spite of himself, very
much in spite of himself, found it impossible
not to laugh also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘ ’Pon my soul! the boy does not lack assurance!
Yes, that I would!’ he said, but added
a moment later, ‘I laugh, but that doth not
retract my displeasure one whit, nor alter a
word of what I have said: Carrie shall never
marry you an I can prevent it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘How long must I wait ere you consider Carrie
of an age to choose for herself?’ asked Phil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Two years, at the earliest. You will then
be of an age to judge for yourself, though
young enough to marry, in all conscience.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘And during these two years how much may
I see of Carrie?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Nothing.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I may write to her at times?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘No, never; you forget, Mr. Meadowes,
that my object is that you should forget one
another so speedily as may be.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip bowed, accepting the inevitable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘If that be all, there remains nothing but
that I should say my farewells,’ said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Nothing; the sooner and the shorter they
are the better,’ said Sebastian. He looked at
the two young people before him. Carrie stood
scared and silent by the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil crossed over to where she stood and
gathered her up in his arms, kissing her long
and fondly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘If it must be.—Good-bye, sweetheart, I
shall never forget,’ he said. And Carrie, as
she raised her lips to his, smiled an almost
happy smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They vowed at that moment an unspoken
vow, and parted undoubtingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Come, dearest sir!’ said Carrie a moment
later, when Phil was gone; ‘shall we return
to London to-night—you and I?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘There! if you wish to see the last of him,’
said Sebastian. He pointed out to the courtyard,
where the ostler had led out Phil’s horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Lord! what a temper the boy hath!’ said
Sebastian, for Phil, without one backward look
to the window where Carrie stood, gave a savage
lash at the horse, which bounded out
through the archway, and swung round the
turn that led into the Wynford road with scant
direction from its rider.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘The Lord send him safe at Fairmeadowes,’
said Carrie softly, under her breath.</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie and her father found it a little difficult
to explain her sudden flight to Lady Mallow;
but they patched up some sort of story that
held together after a fashion, and before very
long her Ladyship had forgotten all about Carrie’s
escapade, as she considered it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie meantime had returned to London
with her father, and the time passed slowly
enough at first. But Carrie had not the nature
that broods over the inevitable, and she quieted
her heart better than most girls of her age
would have done in the same trying circumstances.
There were all the cheerful businesses
of home to attend to—Carrie was a notable
housekeeper,—and these, after the forced idleness
and gentility of her stay at Lady Mallow’s,
seemed doubly delightful. It was much more
agreeable to eat the pasties and cakes of one’s
own making, she thought, than those prepared
by the most practised cook, and, moreover,
there was a new and inspiring thought at work
in Carrie’s brain. Some day she would be
cooking all these good things for Philip! She
did not stop to consider that Phil, like Lady
Mallow, had servants to cook for him, so every
day she would be trying new dishes, till Sebastian
complained that the <span class='it'>cuisine</span> was too rich
for his simple tastes, and Carrie blushed, and
murmured something about her book of recipes.
The afternoons, when her father was busy and
her housekeeping labours were over for the day,
were the longest time to get through. Carrie
would take her needlework then and sit by
the window, but she found plenty time for
thought while she sewed, and her thoughts
seemed always to travel in the direction of
Wynford. Had Phil gone back to Oxford yet?
she wondered; or was it possible he was come
to town? When could she see him again?
What was he doing? All the ingeniously
ridiculous questions and suppositions of lovers
passed through her head in these long afternoons
of sewing. In the evenings Sebastian
would take her out to walk or to the play, and
Carrie could not be insensible of the admiration
she excited in public places. Then summer
wore away and winter was come. Carrie indulged
in some new and very becoming winter
garments, and was more fidgety than was her
wont over the fit and the style of them. When
these were ready she persuaded her father one
fine Saturday afternoon to take her for an airing
in the Mall. Sebastian hesitated a little,
and professed himself too busy, but at last consented,
and Carrie—exquisitely bewitching in
her furry hood—walked at a slow pace down
the Mall by his side, the admired of all admirers.
Now there exists between some people
a mysterious sympathy—telepathy, we call it
in the nineteenth century, in the eighteenth it
was not named—which premonishes them of
meeting, just as the quicksilver in an aneroid
will foretell the weather of the coming day.
When Carrie dressed herself in all her bravery,
and prayed her father for his escort, she was
convinced deep down in her heart that she
would meet Phil that day. She had no reason
whatever to suppose that he was in town; she
had walked out every day since they parted
and never met him, but to-day she felt certain
she would do so. It came to her therefore as
no surprise to hear her father say—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Carrie, there comes Philip Meadowes.’ She
did not need to be admonished of the fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘May I speak with him, sir?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘No.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had passed almost before the question
and answer were spoken. Carrie did not even
bow to him in the passing, but she smiled a
brilliant flashing smile and blushed like a rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Phil looks older, does he not, sir?’ she
asked, as they walked along—only her quick-drawn
breath and the excited little pinch she
gave to her father’s arm betrayed her excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sebastian did not reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the next Sunday that Carrie made a
delightful discovery: Phil had begun to come
to church at St. Mary Minories! Carrie was
just stifling a yawn behind her hand, when,
across the little church, she caught sight of
Phil. He sat just opposite her—why, why
was the service so very short? Carrie, who
was as regular a slumberer as she was an attendant
upon Church services, now sat forward in
the great square pew, wide awake, and any observant
person must have noted how her eyes
wandered across the church, and met those of
the young man who occupied the opposite pew.
Then she would flicker her eyelids and look
down and blush an enchanting blush under the
shade of the great feathered hat she wore, and
then the same thing would be gone through
over again. Phil, on his part, leant forward,
staring unabashedly at Carrie. He was delighted
to observe that her sole guardian during
church hours was Lady Mallow, and Lady Mallow,
like her niece, slept whenever it was possible
to do so. After they had mutually made
these pleasant discoveries I suppose it would
have been difficult to find two happier young
people than they were that morning. Every
circumstance seemed to be fortunate for them,
for Phil saw to his delight that Lady Mallow,
whose pew was near the door, seemed to be in
the habit of letting all the congregation disperse
before she left it. This quite suited Phil.
He walked slowly down the aisle and passed so
near Carrie that his sleeve brushed hers for a
moment—for Carrie had risen, and now fumbled
at the door of the pew in the most opportune
manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie said nothing about this to her father;
she thought the meeting had been accidental;
but when another, and yet another, and yet
another Sunday passed, and on each day she
saw Phil, Carrie, out of the depth of her honest
heart, found it necessary to tell Sebastian
about it. She came and stood behind his chair,
let her pretty white hands fall one over each
shoulder, and laid her cheek against his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Dear sir,’ she said, ‘I think I should tell
you something—I think ’tis scarce honest in
me to be silent about it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Eh?’ queried Sebastian, as he turned to
kiss one of Carrie’s hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I must tell you, sir, that I see Philip Meadowes
each Lord’s day at church in St. Mary
Minories. I have never spoken with him, but
I fear we look at each other most part of the
morning.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Well,’ said Sebastian, ‘what of it?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘May I continue to go to church, sir? I
feared you might forbid me,’ said Carrie, her
heart bounding with hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘The deuce take your honesty, Carrie. Do
you think I can forbid you now?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie laughed with delight—words after all
were not everything. If once each week she
could sit and gaze at Philip, a year and a half
would surely pass quickly enough!</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>There is no reckoning with the infinite possibilities
for variation in human character, which
is one of the reasons why all ‘theories’ of education
are doomed to failure. Yet you will
sometimes hear the cleverest men and women
lay down general axioms, forgetful of this
qualifying phrase, that may upset the entire
calculation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Richard Meadowes—in other matters a man
of considerable acuteness, fell into this common
snare. The axiom which misled him was one
which has been accepted—well-nigh proven by
half the world: that youth is fickle and forgetful.
Given fresh interests, new playthings,
the young man does not live (said he) who will
not soon forget what so lately charmed him
most. Well, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred
this may be true; but that elusive hundredth
case must also be reckoned with if one
would make certain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Phil must go into society and see other
women; ere six months are passed he will
never give another thought to this Caroline
Shepley,’ said the prudent parent, who had indeed,
on his way through the world, seen many
a man forget. Phil showed scant desire for
society; he declared his inclinations lay rather
in the way of study, and expressed a special
yearning for legal research. But his father opposed
this with wise moderation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘There was of course no reason against it—Phil
might please himself—he was, by now,
old enough to choose his own path in life—but,
if he might suggest it, a Parliamentary career
offered greater scope for his peculiar talents.
Nothing would be easier. A few years hence
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. time passed quickly—there was much to
see and learn meantime .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there was the
world to see, not to speak of the men in it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Should they go the Grand Tour of Europe together?
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No?—ah, well, there was time
enough for that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He preferred London?
Well, there was of course no society like London,
and the proper study of mankind (“clever
mankind, Phil, my son”) was certainly man—learn
men and manners. He did not wish to
go into society? Ah, well, he might stay at
home and do some reading—no time was lost
in reading—he had worked too hard at Oxford
and deserved a rest this winter,’ etc. etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil listened to it all and smiled and took his
own way; he knew perfectly well what his
father’s thoughts were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first, after his parting with Carrie, Phil
was inclined to be rather sulky and moody, but
when he returned to town with his father, and
after he began to attend church with so much
regularity, he came to a more Christian frame
of mind, and exhibited indeed such a markedly
better temper that his father smiled to himself
and said all was going well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil now showed no disinclination for society,
and indeed entered upon its pleasures with
peculiar zest. He even plunged deep into a
flirtation—a hopeful sign—with a certain Lady
Hester Ware, a pretty, witty young Irishwoman,
without a penny to her fortune. Meadowes
was delighted; he would have welcomed
a daughter of the beggar Lazarus as Phil’s
chosen bride at that moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With commendable caution he paid not the
slightest attention to the affair; for he knew
the contradictious human spirit, and Phil flirted
on. But at last, when the matter seemed quite
an established fact, he expressed to Phil his
great admiration for Lady Hester.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘There’s a clever woman!’ he exclaimed in
conclusion. But his breath was taken away by
Phil’s response—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Clever? yes, deucedly clever. I hate clever
women, and if you like ’em, sir, you’re the first
man that ever did!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘ ’Pon my soul!’ exclaimed Meadowes, with
a long whistle of astonishment; then he added
severely, ‘If you do not like Lady Hester, Phil,
you do very wrong to trifle with her affections,
as you have been doing this many a day.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘ ’Tis, as you say, sir, an unpardonable sin to
play a woman false—may Heaven forbid I
should fall into it!’ said Phil in pious tones,
and Meadowes, as he met the boy’s bright eyes,
turned uneasily away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Richard Meadowes had, you see, not added
this cynical axiom to his collection:—that most
men, when desperate about one woman, will
plunge into a flirtation with another: so he
was at a loss to account for Phil’s conduct, if it
was not actuated by admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil was not really doing anything extraordinary—he
was only trying to find an answer
to the question ‘how best to pass two years?’—two
years that seemed to him to expand into
a lifetime as he looked ahead, for he was of an
impatient temperament. Six months had
passed before the happy expedient of seeing
Carrie at church suggested itself to his mind;
and by dint of this device six months more
were got over. But with the spring’s return
came a crowd of tender remembrances, and
Phil grew very sulky and despondent again.
His father had gone to Fairmeadowes, but Phil,
grown now very emancipated, refused to leave
London; ‘The country was dull,’ said he, who
aforetime loved it so well. He had come to an
end of his flirtation—and the lees of a flirtation
are the sourest beverage; he could gain no distraction
from it any longer: he was at his wit’s
end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he walked moodily down the Square one
morning about this time, Phil heard his name
spoken, and, turning round, found Mr. Simon
Prior by his side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, if there was a man that Philip disliked
more than another it was this Simon Prior.
A tall man, with shoulders so high that he
seemed to be always shrugging them, and with
prominent eyes that had a look of bullying
challenge in them, he certainly did not carry
innocence upon his face. He always assumed
great familiarity with Phil—another point
against him with the young man. But he,
this morning, was so at a loss for a new shiver
as almost to welcome this man; could he possibly
yield him any amusement?</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Yes, my father is at Fairmeadowes, sir,’ he
said in response to the elder man’s greeting,
and they fell into step.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘And you, Philip? Once upon a time you
too loved Fairmeadowes—why are times so
changed?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Age, sir, age,’ laughed Philip. ‘And indeed
I am become very old, for I can hit on
nothing will amuse me these days.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘A sad case. What have you tried?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil was prudent; he might almost have
been a Scotsman from his reply—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘What, sir, would you recommend?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Oh, there are many ways for passing the
time, Philip.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘That’s not all I wish. ’Tis—’tis—oh,
there’s no new thing under the sun!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Women!—there’s considerable variety
there,’ began Prior, and he treated Phil to one
of his bullying stares.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil shrugged his shoulders and shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Well, if you do not fancy that—let me see—gaming,
if you can gain or lose sufficiently
large sums, is not amiss, for a distraction.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Which means that you wish me to play
with you?’ said Phil. ‘I shall do so gladly,
sir, if so be you’ll play for large enough stakes.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Phil played his pockets empty that fine
morning, and felt the amusing sensation of impecuniosity
for a few weeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came too into considerable familiarity
with Simon Prior these days, a familiarity he
had no wish to encourage, yet found it difficult
to shake off. Wherever he went Prior was
sure to appear—quite by accident, it would
seem—till Philip began to suspect that his
father had something to do in the matter.
Once this thought had occurred to him, Phil, in
sudden and hot resentment, behaved to Mr.
Simon Prior with very scant courtesy. His resentment
burned hotly also against his father.
What was he that he should be spied upon in
this way? If his father distrusted him, why
could he not say so to his face instead of setting
this odious man to spy upon him and report his
every action? And he had been frank enough
with his father when they first spoke about
Carrie; he knew and, apparently, acquiesced
in his resolution to win her. Why then all this
curiosity?—‘Bah, it was disgusting,’ said Phil
in his indignation. A day or two later he left
for Fairmeadowes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You had best have me under your own eye,
sir,’ he said in reply to his father’s surprised
greeting.</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie, as may be surmised, never spoke about
Philip to her father. She was therefore rather
surprised when one morning he passed her the
<span class='it'>Gentleman’s Magazine</span>, and pointed to a short
paragraph in it:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Mr. Richard Meadowes and Mr. Philip
Meadowes left London yesterday for Paris.
They purpose making the Grand Tour of Europe,
a circumstance which will deprive society
of two of its greatest ornaments,’ etc. etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie blushed, and felt very miserable, thinking
how long an absence that meant on Phil’s
part—he would not be in church next Sunday,
nor any Sunday for months to come!—‘Ah,
Philip, why did you go?’ she asked herself.
Sebastian on his part was well content, and this
perhaps made him acquiesce more than it was
natural for him to do in a plan which Lady
Mallow divulged to him that very afternoon.
This was no less a scheme than Carrie’s entrance
into Society (with a large S).</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘For a young gentlewoman of Carrie’s parts
and appearance she leads by far too quiet a life,
sir,’ said her Ladyship. ‘And now that I am
returned to town, I am resolved that Carrie
shall make the figure she ought in Society.
’Twas her good mother’s desire, I feel certain,
and, moreover, Carrie herself will delight in it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Perhaps you speak truly, Charlotte,’ said
Sebastian, ‘and for certain my Carrie hath
charms enough and to spare. I fear you’ll
have some difficulty with her adorers ere long
if you take her into Society, as you call it; but
if the girl is of the same mind with yourself, I
have naught to say against it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Mallow thought Carrie rather lack-lustre
over this generous proposal. She did not seem
to wish much to go to balls and routs, though
she was far too good-natured to show her disinclination
very openly—still there was a want
of that exuberant whole-heartedness in the pursuit
of pleasure which used to characterise her
at one time. Carrie only smiled her charming
smile and said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You are most kind, madam; ’twill be most
agreeable, I am certain.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not even kindle to great interest over
her new dresses. What was the use? Philip
would not see them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Mallow’s ‘circle,’ as she would have
called it, received the beautiful Caroline Shepley
with open arms. She might have danced
her pretty little feet off had she had a mind to,
and might have had her head turned round on
her shoulders if the compliments she received
had only seemed to her worth the getting.
But, alas, Carrie listened coldly to all the compliments
that were showered upon her. She
judged every man she met by one standard—Philip,—and
none of them ever came up to it.
There was indeed about Philip a certain careless
elegance quite unattainable, or at least
quite unattained, by the other young men of
Carrie’s acquaintance. He was not particular
about anything he said or did, yet it seemed to
Carrie he could say or do with impunity what,
if done by any other man, would have offended
her in every way. Lady Mallow made matters
worse by continually urging Carrie to think
seriously about this or that man who paid her
attentions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Indeed, my dear niece, you should not be
so saucy; for all your looks and the little
money your good father may leave you, you
will be left a maiden lady—that pitiable being,—if
you despise good offers such as those of
Mr. Sedgebrooke and Captain Cole, as pretty-mannered
gentlemen both as you are like to
meet, of good family (though untitled), and
personable men to look at. Sedgebrooke hath
a thousand a year to his fortune, and the Captain,
though not so well to do, is an officer and
a gentleman—two very good things.’ Thus
Lady Mallow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Carrie was obdurate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I cannot abide Sedgebrooke, madam, and
for Cole, the sight of his hands is enough for
me—bah, I hate fat hands: the hands of a
gentleman should be thin and brown by my
way of thinking.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>So both of these eligible gentlemen were refused.
But as time wore on Lady Mallow was
pleased to observe how much brighter Carrie
had become. Her eyes had an exquisite
sparkle, she seemed always smiling. ‘Society
hath begun to brighten Carrie,’ she said to
Sebastian, who growled, and remarked that he
had never thought her dull. It was not Society,
however, that was brightening Carrie, but
the fact that Phil had returned to town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had met him one afternoon as she walked
with her aunt in the gardens at Vauxhall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘My dear Carrie, see there,’ Lady Mallow
had said. ‘There is Mr. Philip Meadowes, the—I
regret to say it—the natural son of Mr.
Richard Meadowes of Fairmeadowes, the property
which adjoins to mine at Wynford. For
certain I thought it curious that he paid no
attention to Sir James, but his infrequent visits
to Fairmeadowes no doubt explained the circumstance,
for on every hand I have accounts
of the affability both of the father and the son.
They are beloved in the neighbourhood.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>The good lady rattled on long after the subject
of her discourse had passed by. She did
not guess how much Phil was beloved in a
neighbourhood very close to her at that moment.
Carrie listened to her aunt’s talk with
heightened colour and sparkling eyes. How
different Philip had looked! how much older!
He looked boyish no longer—and yet he was
the same, her dearest Phil, who would come
very soon to claim her now.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What would
her father say that day? Carrie’s joy was
checked at the thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the last month or two of these two years
of waiting Carrie could not be tender enough
to her father. She was with him every moment
of his spare time, and sat by him in the
evening, and held his hand till he laughed and
asked her the reason of all this sentiment.
Carrie laughed also, but her eyes filled with
tears; she knew the blow that impended over
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last one night she determined to speak.
She sat down beside her father and laid her
face against his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Sir, I feel certain that ere long Philip Meadowes
will come to claim your promise,’ she
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She felt her father draw in his breath hard
before he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I thought you had forgot Philip Meadowes,’
he said at length.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I—forgotten—oh, sir, so soon? What do
you take me for?’ cried Carrie. She raised
her face for a moment as she spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Then you mean to have him?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Yes, sir; I can do no other thing.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sebastian rose, and pushed Carrie from him
almost with roughness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘If you marry this man, Carrie, you part
from me; you cannot know all ’twould mean
to me. You are too young, you have been
ever too happy, even to guess at it. I repeat:
Marry Philip Meadowes and part from me, or
stay with me and part from him.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie in her agitation rose and stood beside
her father. Then suddenly she flung herself
into his arms in her impetuous childish fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Oh, sir, I must—I must. I cannot part
from Philip; he is grown to be like part of
myself,’ she cried in a passion of tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sebastian raised Carrie’s face to his and kissed
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I do not blame you, Carrie—I cannot blame
you, for you act too entirely as I would have
acted myself. I only bid you good-bye.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Could you never know him and love him,
sir?’ asked Carrie timidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘May the Lord forgive me!—no, Carrie;
not even for your sake.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘ ’Twill half break my heart to leave you,
sir,’ said Carrie; ‘but ’twould break quite in
two if I left Phil. Oh, what am I to do?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Leave me,’ said Sebastian, and without another
word he turned on his heel and went out.</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>It would seem that this marriage was to cause
sad feelings to more households than one; for
not many days after Carrie and Sebastian had
settled matters after this sad fashion, Phil and
his father also came to an understanding on the
same point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Philip,’ said his father, ‘I wish you would
get married one of these days; ’tis a good thing
for a young man to marry early: it settles him
for life.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Far from wishing Philip to marry, there was
nothing his father was less anxious for; but he
thought this a skilful way in which to discover
whether his son still hankered after Caroline
Shepley—a direct question was the last method
ever employed by Richard Meadowes. He was
therefore not a little taken aback at Phil’s
reply:</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Well, sir, that is exactly what I intend to
do, if so be you will make me a sufficient settlement
to marry upon.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘And—the lady?’ asked Meadowes. He
looked down as he spoke, and twirled the ring
he wore round and round upon his finger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Is Caroline Shepley, as you cannot doubt, sir.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Caroline Shepley! I thought, Phil, you
had forgot all that nonsense long ago. Let me
see: two years ago, is it not, since you first
saw her? And since then you have not seen
much of her, unless I mistake strangely.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Nothing. I promised her father to see
nothing of her for two years.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You saw—Sebastian Shepley?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Yes, sir.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘And have you had no communication with
his daughter since?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I as good as promised him, sir; and I am
in the habit of keeping my promises.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Of course—of course,’ said Meadowes hurriedly;
‘but in two years’ time that handsome
young woman must have found plenty other
men to adore her charms. You make too sure
of yourself, Phil, if you suppose she hath waited
these two years.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I do not fear that I shall find myself supplanted,’
said Phil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘And should she think of you, are you in
earnest in your intention of marrying her?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘More in earnest than ever before in life.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You cannot expect me to provide you with
the means for a marriage of which I disapprove?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip leaned forward, fixing his bright eyes
on his father’s face. He held him captive while
he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Yes, sir; I do not see how you can do otherwise;
for you are my father, which makes you
responsible for me. You have brought me up
in luxury, but you have not educated me for
any profession. You could not suppose that I
would always do exactly as you desired just
because I happened to be dependent upon you
instead of having a profession such as most men
have? I may be dependent on you for money,
sir, but I am so only on condition that I am
entirely independent of you in the conduct of
my life. ’Tis your duty to give me the fortune
you have always led me to expect; but if you
refuse it because I intend to marry Caroline
Shepley, I must then ask you to support me for
a few years more till I can learn to support
myself and her. If you refuse me this money
it will not keep me from marrying her—nothing
will; but I must repeat again that if you
educate a man to expect a fortune at your
hands, you cannot blame him for calculating
upon it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meadowes rose and paced up and down the
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘What you say is true, Phil,’ he said at last;
‘the money is yours.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Thank you, sir! I trust you will not regret
the decision.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Philip,’ cried his father suddenly, crossing
over to where the young man stood, and laying
his hand on his arm,—‘Philip, as you love me
do not marry this girl!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>There fell a short silence before Phil spoke:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘But the plain fact is, sir, <span class='it'>I do not love you!</span>’
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whirlwind! the whirlwind! How it
swept now over the man, who, for half a lifetime,
had been sowing the wind! It came up
and smote the four corners of the house of life
where he feasted at his ease, and before the inrush
of the blast he trembled and was afraid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Have I not done everything for you, Philip?’
he said, in a hard, cold voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Everything, sir. Do not misunderstand
me; I am quite aware of all I owe you.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘What more can I do, Phil, that I have not
done?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Nothing, sir!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Then why do you not love me?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Because I cannot trust you—never have and
never can,—though ’tis brutal of me to say so.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I think you may go, Philip,’ said his father.
He did not speak angrily, nor indeed did he
feel any anger at Phil. But the end had come.
His last chance for love in this world had
failed. He had dreaded this for long. Year
by year, as Phil grew older, the separation between
them had been gradually widening, an
estrangement which the very similarity of their
natures, in some respects, seemed to emphasise.
Now the breach was open. And Phil had,
without doubt, the right of the matter. ‘I
scarce know how I looked that he should trust
me,’ thought the unhappy man, ‘but I have
renounced so much for the boy’s sake,—I have
renounced marriage even, lest another son
should supplant him; and I doubt if Phil hath
ever realised all this, else surely he had not
spoken with such cruelty to-night. For the
rest of it, youth is sharp to notice, and, when
I consider, do I ever speak or act straightly
now? Once I did surely? I cannot now.
My whole nature leans sidewise, like the tower
of Pisa, toppling but still standing.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’m
rotten through and through, and Phil knows
it,—and—— Oh, forsaken, forsaken!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat forward with his head bent on his
clasped hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘<span class='it'>A sword shall pierce thine own heart</span>,’ he
said.</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>After the plain speaking which had passed between
Richard Meadowes and his son, a readjustment
of their relationships seemed necessary.
It was not possible for them to keep up
the former pretence of amity, yet Meadowes
was anxious that no hint of their differences
should reach the outside world. He called
Philip to him one day and explained the case
to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I would not have all the world know how it
fares betwixt us, Phil,’ he said. ‘I had rather
keep that bitter knowledge to myself; but
things being as they are, ’twill be better for us
now to live apart,—the one at Fairmeadowes,
the other in town. I purpose after this date
giving over the house in St. James’ Square to
you, while I reside myself at Fairmeadowes.
I care no longer for the amusements of the
town.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil objected at first to this arrangement as
too generous. ‘You will tire of a rural existence,
sir,’ he said, ‘ere six months are gone,
and then—supposing me to have married in
the meantime—I and my wife will have to rearrange
our establishment once more. ’Twould
be better for you to keep the house in town,
and let me have another and smaller one.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Meadowes would not hear of this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I cannot tell you, Phil, how it is with me,’
he said, leaning his head on his hand as he
spoke. ‘And—may you never understand—a
great weariness hath fallen over me, that is of
the mind, not of the body. I care for nothing;
the game is played out. So make no further
parley over this; take what I offer and welcome:
as you pointed out to me ’tis but your
due, in a sense.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Then you fully understand, sir, that I bring
Carrie Shepley to live in your house?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Bring her and welcome—ah, you think that
will bring you happiness, Phil, but you are mistaken.
Happiness is a creature of the fancy,
she is never caught and held; always flits
ahead. You’ll not find her in Carrie Shepley—no,
nor in aught in this world.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘My dear sir, I fear you will be turning
monk, when I hear you despise the good things
of this world, as you do just now,’ said Phil.
He laid his hand on his father’s shoulder with
the caressing way he had to every one. Meadowes
smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I know better than to think happiness lies
there either,’ he said.—‘But to return to business:
you mean to marry this girl as soon as
may be?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘So soon as she will have me, sir.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I shall make you an allowance then, Phil,
and the house in St. James’ Square; and you
understand that the outer world still considers
us as a devoted father and son.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘They will be right to name you a generous
father at least, sir,’ said Phil, and he held out
his hand suddenly to his father as he spoke.
‘Don’t name me ungrateful, sir,’ he added;
‘I see all you have done for me.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a very painful moment to them both,
for each understood how one spontaneous expression
of affection on Phil’s part would have
taken away all difficulty from the situation;
and yet the possibility of giving it was not
there. Gratitude, however sincere it may be,
if unwarmed by love, is cold as icicles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now that his affairs were arranged in this
unsatisfactory fashion, Phil lost no time in presenting
himself at Jermyn Street, to ask for the
hand of Miss Caroline Shepley in marriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie stood at the window that evening
looking out into the dusty little street, when
all at once she saw Phil come up the steps and
heard his knock at the door. Her father sat
by the fire reading, unsuspicious of the blow
that was about to fall. Carrie turned away
from the window and came towards him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Father,’ she said, in a very tense voice, then
waited for a moment, not knowing what to
say; and Phil, who was very impatient that
night, knocked again more loudly than before.
‘I am sure my heart makes as much noise as
the knocker!’ thought Carrie, as she listened.
Sebastian looked up—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Well? what is it, my daughter?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘<span class='it'>Philip</span>,’ said Carrie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then as in a dream she heard Patty’s familiar
voice announce her lover’s name, and a moment
later saw her dear Phil stand beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘How are you, Carrie?’ he said, as if they
had never been parted, and then he held out
his hand to Sebastian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I fear I come as an unwelcome guest, sir,’
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I cannot welcome you,’ said Sebastian
shortly; but he motioned to Phil to take a
seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I need not tell you why I am come, sir,’
pursued Phil, who wasted no time upon preliminaries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I have given Carrie her choice betwixt you
and me; ’tis for her to speak,’ said Sebastian
for answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie had been standing behind her father
during this conversation; she came now and
sat on the arm of his chair, bent down, and
whispered a few words in his ear. He rose,
and taking her hand in his held it for a moment
and then laid it in Phil’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘She belongs to you now, Philip Meadowes,’
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Oh, dada dear, love him too!’ pleaded
Carrie, and the tears gathered in her blue eyes
at the cold sound of her father’s voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You ask the impossible, Carrie,’ said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Perhaps, sir, time may soften the prejudice
you entertain for me,’ said Phil. ‘Indeed I
shall do my utmost to make Carrie a good husband.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Do not misunderstand me, Meadowes,’ said
Sebastian. ‘The feeling I have against you is
quite impersonal, else I had not given you Carrie’s
hand in marriage. I think you will make
her happy; but for all that I cannot be your
friend, I cannot bear to look upon your face!’
He rose at the last words and left the room,
and Carrie and Phil looked at each in perplexity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Ah, Phil, ’tis terrible,’ said Carrie, ‘and I
so happy! my dearest father——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil refused to look upon the tragic side of
the case, however. He was far too pleased to
think anything very far wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Dear heart, you must not grieve; Dr. Shepley
will forget after a time; the best you can
do is to marry me at once. When that is done
he will forgive you. He thinks now to prevent
the wedding by his displeasure, but when he
sees that impossible his resentment will die out.
Come, Carrie, the sooner you arrange for our
marriage the better ’twill be for all concerned.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps Carrie did not need very much persuasion.
Two years of waiting had been quite
long enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I shall see my aunt, Lady Mallow, and she
will decide the date for us,’ she said, and then,
as Phil prepared to go, she whispered, ‘I shall
make her arrange it soon.’</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of her happiness Carrie made a very
tearful bride. The parting from her father was
exquisitely painful to her, and not all Phil’s endearments
could at first bring a smile to her
lips. For Sebastian had told her that he could
have nothing to do with her now, that their
parting was final. The only way in which
Carrie could hear of how he fared was by sending
Peter to inquire of Patty, and Patty (a
mature spinster), while she inwardly exclaimed
over the turn of Fortune’s wheel which thus
brought her former admirer again to her door,
was fain to invent messages which would reassure
Carrie’s anxious heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Lor’! Mr. Peter,’ she would say, ‘ ’tis distressful
to see the Doctor now-a-days.—And
how doth dear Miss Carrie (as was) do?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Mrs. Meadowes has her health perfect,’
Peter would respond, ‘but is ever fretting over
the Doctor, so I had best make up some message
from you, and mayhap some evening you
might step down to the Square yourself and
make her more easy in the mind about him?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty, in spite of her years and her wisdom,
would shake her head coquettishly at this suggestion,
and invent some message for Peter
which had no foundation in fact. ‘The Doctor
is well, madam, and eats hearty; was out
the most part of the day at the hospital, and
dined with his friend Dr. Munro,’ Peter would
announce. And on such fragments Carrie had
to appease her hungry heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sebastian, poor man, had never been less inclined
for social intercourse; had never eaten
his meals with so little ‘heartiness’; had never
visited the hospitals so seldom; but those two
well-meaning retainers thought it kinder to
suppress the true facts of the case—and perhaps
they were right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Never fear, Carrie; he will come round—parents
always do; they can’t do without us,’
Phil used to say. ‘I wish you knew all the
disputes I’ve had with my father!’ But Carrie
said the cases were not quite similar, she
fancied, and refused to be comforted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘ ’Tis well I am so beautifully happy with
you, Phil,’ she said one day, ‘for this trouble
weighs so on my heart that had I any other
’twould break in two.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Oh, no fear!’ laughed Phil. They led a
very gay life, these two exceedingly irresponsible
young people, and indeed, older heads were
nodded in wisdom, and prophecies were made
that Carrie would have trouble enough with
her wild young husband. Philip seemed, for
the present at least, to have given up work of
any kind. He meant to be in Parliament some
day, he told Carrie, meantime he would enjoy
himself and see the world. He was also letting
Carrie see it, a process she much enjoyed, and,
in Phil’s company, entered into with all her
heart, unlike the lack-lustre young woman who
had gone about with Lady Mallow the preceding
winter. Carrie was now introduced into
far finer circles than those of her worthy aunt.
Her name figured in all the reports of what we
should in this vulgar age call ‘smart’ society—a
fact which afforded her a good deal of natural
mundane satisfaction. ‘The beautiful Mrs.
Meadowes,’ ‘Handsome Mrs. Philip Meadowes,’
‘That most charming lady, Mrs. Meadowes’—these
and similar descriptions of herself
made Carrie dimple with pleasure. But a
woman in such a position, so young, so beautiful,
so unsophisticated, would, to defend herself
aright, require a beak and claws, whereas our
gentle Carrie had not even a sharp tongue
wherewith to chastise her enemies. She entered
society with no protection but simplicity—a
much vaunted armour which, alas for the
world, is in reality sadly vulnerable. Brought
up as she had been almost exclusively among
men—and honest men into the bargain—Carrie
was quite ignorant of the wiles of her own sex,
and scolded Philip heartily when he ventured
to warn her against them; while, for the
sterner sex, she entertained almost pathetic
feelings of confidence and liking. The men did
not exist (in consequence) who could resist her,
and this more than any other cause at last
opened Carrie’s eyes a little to the involutions
of the feminine character. Alas! too late;
half the women in London were jealous of her
before Carrie was even distantly aware of it.
She had smilingly accepted flowers and attention
from many a man before it occurred to her
that other women might be wanting them instead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Just singe your wings, my dear butterfly,’
said Phil, ‘then you will understand what the
candle is.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Philip, it must be from your father you take
such base views of human nature,’ said Carrie.
‘For certainly you have not lived long enough
yourself to learn such views. ’Tis not my
fault that I am good-looking, and I do not believe
for a moment that other women dislike
me for it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Wait—ah, just wait, Carrie. I agree with
you that they do not dislike you for it—<span class='it'>hate</span> is
the word.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Phil, I am ashamed to hear my husband say
such things,’ said Carrie, though she laughed
in spite of herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have said that Carrie liked and trusted all
men; but with one exception—she could not
abide the sight of Simon Prior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I cannot say what it is, Phil,’ she said one
day, ‘but to speak with Mr. Prior doth turn
me sick. Pray, my dearest, is he a great
friend? Could you not intimate to him that
he visits my drawing-room too frequently?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Prior had certainly got into a strange habit
of haunting the house in St. James’ Square,
considering how very lukewarm a reception he
always received there. Carrie was one of those
fortunate women who find it quite impossible
to be anything except pleasant to every one.
She would sit, smiling and charming, beside
Simon Prior, while all the time she loathed the
sound of his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Do not be so pleasant to the man, Carrie,’
Phil suggested; and Carrie in genuine amazement
opened her blue eyes widely:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Philip, I was most discourteous to him but
yesterday! Twice he hinted at his wish to
accompany me on my airing, and each time I
took no notice of his remark.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘But you smiled all the time, and seemed
merely not to have noticed the hint, Carrie—instead
of appearing purposely to ignore it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I tried my best; in honesty, Phil, I tried
my best to be disagreeable,’ sighed Carrie, ‘so
you must do it for me if I cannot manage it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil had no scruples. He waited for Prior
to call again, and then set about finding some
matter to differ upon; but Prior himself brought
about the dispute finally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I should like a word with you, Philip,’ he
said, as he rose to say good-bye, and Phil, with
a quite perceptible shrug, led the way into the
library.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I wondered—not to beat about the bush,
for frankness between friends is a good thing—I
wondered, in fact, Philip, if you could accommodate
me with a small loan—some £20, or
perhaps less; I happen to be very much pressed
just now; I—in fact, ’twould be a great boon.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘No,’ said Phil curtly; ‘I fear I cannot
oblige you.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Oh, I am sure you can. Your father would
advance me the money to-morrow were he in
town, and I look upon you as his representative,’
began Prior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Were I in the way of lending money, sir,’
said Phil with great deliberation, ‘ ’twould be
to another sort of man than you.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Ha, ha—very good—the poor ever with us,’
said Prior uneasily; ‘but indeed you make a
mistake when you take me for a rich man. I
am constantly pressed for funds, as you see me
to-day; you could scarcely find a needier object
for accommodation, you——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I could easily find a better,’ said Phil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Philip, you call my honour in question!’
cried Prior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I would never trouble to do so,’ said Phil;
‘because I do not consider that you have got
any.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>For far less provocation men in those fighting
days had risked their precious lives, as Phil
was well aware. He had calculated the
chances of having to fight with Prior, and his
calculations were verified: Prior had no intention
of fighting; he had swallowed many an
insult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘For your father’s sake, Philip, I will not go
further into the dispute,’ he said with the sorry
attempt at dignity of a man who knows himself
in the wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip walked to the door and flung it open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Adieu, Mr. Simon Prior,’ he said with
great mock ceremony. And Carrie was not
troubled with any more visits.</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>Simon Prior had come out to Fairmeadowes to
beg. It was not the first time he had begged
from Richard Meadowes, and he had little
shame about doing it. He even assumed a
slightly bullying air as he made his modest demand
for £100—he had not gone so high with
Philip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meadowes sat by the fire in his usual easy
lounging attitude. He did not look like a man
inclined to dispute anything, and he listened
quietly to Prior’s demand. But after he had
considered it for a moment he spoke with the
greatest decision of tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘No, Prior; I have decided to give you no
more. You’ve been bleeding me these twenty
years, now you’ll bleed me no longer.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Prior stood aghast, and Meadowes continued,
‘Angry, I suppose? Well, take what revenge
you will. Mine is an old story now. Your
own character, such as it is, will suffer full as
much as mine should you make it public.’ He
paused and drew his hand slowly across his
eyes. ‘The fact is, I care no longer: I have
nothing to lose: life is done—I would it had
never begun for me. Mistake upon mistake;
and now a dead heart. D’you remember the
old torment? They used to build living men
into a wall slowly with bricks and mortar;
every day the tomb closed more and more round
them. Well, I am alive still, but the wall is
closing round me; it hath reached the heart
now and presses sore upon it—well-nigh hath
pressed the life out of it. I have built myself
into this living tomb with my own hands too—there’s
the special torture.’ He paused, wondering
if Prior understood one half of his meaning.
He did not; the higher feelings had been
left out of his nature; he did not even guess at
his friend’s mood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘What ails you to-day, Meadowes?’ he
said; ‘truly this country life is too quiet for
you by half. Come, we shall return to town,
play high, and forget care.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I have no care,’ said Meadowes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘What then?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘A dead—rather a dying—heart, I tell you,
only you do not understand.’ Then, as impulsive
men will often do, Meadowes told out all
his sorrow to this man, just because he did not
understand—it was the same relief as it would
have been to talk aloud to himself. ‘Phil loves
me no more; there’s the fact on’t—I doubt if
ever he hath loved me. I’ve borne a measure
of disgrace for him, I’ve renounced marriage
for his sake, I’ve nurtured him delicately, and
willed half my fortune to him. I’ve loved
that boy foolishly all his days, and now he
turns and tells me he doth not love me. Where
doth the advantage lie of loving aught but oneself?
There’s no return for love, and a fool
I’ve been to sacrifice myself for any man.
’Tis the last lesson I needed. All these fine
theories we dealt in in our youth, theories of
“love” and “sacrifice” and so on, are purest
moonshine. But with the last shreds of belief
I had in them, goes my last shred of caring for
life.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Tush, Meadowes! I must reason with
you,’ said Prior. ‘A man at your time of life
to speak thus! Come, Philip hath treated you
shamefully, like the young scoundrel that he
is. Let me advise you on this point. Bring
him to his senses by some judicious coldness,
and indeed this is not the first time I have
urged you to marry. Now is the time; let no
sentiments for a thankless knave like Philip
keep you from it now; turn him off with a
shilling—he deserves no more.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Prior spoke earnestly, delighted to find some
way of repaying the insult he had received at
Phil’s hand. He flattered himself that he was
making an impression, for his listener sat and
listened to it all in silence. ‘Now, on the score
of our old friendship—’ he went on, but Meadowes
suddenly interrupted him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘There, I hate the very sight of you,’ he
cried. ‘No friendship hath been betwixt us,
only the bonds of iniquity, and heavy they’ve
been. I’ll have it no more; I’ll go to hell
alone—not in your company.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Prior stood dumb with surprise; so long they
had held together for evil, he could scarcely
credit that the rupture had come at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘But——’ he began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘No more, no more,’ said Meadowes, and he
rose from his seat, and stretched out his hands
in a sudden agonised way. ‘Don’t you know
me yet, Prior? <span class='it'>I can’t be true.</span> Sooner or
later I turn upon every man that leans on me.
Man, I know myself—cruelly well; this is but
the old story. You’ve served my turn, I need
you no more, so I leave you. Yes, sink or
swim for me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You should have known
better than to trust me.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I’ve done your dirty work these twenty
years,’ said Prior, with unblushing veracity,
‘and now you forget it all.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Yes, I mean to forget.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘But I am indeed hard pressed for money.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Well, find it elsewhere.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Is this final?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Quite.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Prior moved towards the door, but he paused
for a moment on the threshold and looked back.
‘They call you Judas in the Clubs,’ said he,
‘and they are right—no man ever yet trusted
you but he was betrayed.’ He walked out,
slamming the door behind him, and Meadowes
listened to hear his footsteps die away along
the passage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘A bad man,’ he meditated, ‘but not as bad
as myself, though the world takes him to be
worse. He’ll end on the gallows—the world
will blame him; but the blame will lie with
me—I who made him what he is—and I shall
sleep with my fathers in the chapel like a
Christian.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Prior meantime walked away through the
quiet winter woods—a figure which accorded
ill with rural scenes, he so carried with him the
savour of towns, the atmosphere of dissipation.
A miserable man—to be moral,—pressed for
money and at an end of his resources, at an
end of pleasure and beginning to realise it;
angry, baffled, rejected. He stood to take a
last look at Fairmeadowes, lying so peacefully
among its wooded fields, with the placid river
flowing past it, and then, overpowered by anger,
he shook his fist in the air and cursed aloud
in that silent place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘By ——!’ he cried, ‘you’ll pay me yet
for all I’ve done these twenty years! I’ll have
your money, or’—his raised right hand fell—‘wanting
that, I’ll have your blood.’</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>As time went on Society began to surmise that
Philip Meadowes and his father were not upon
the best of terms. The elder man seldom came
to town, and when he did, never stayed at his
own house, then tenanted by Philip; and this
of itself was eloquent of differences. But as
against this was the very fact of Philip’s tenancy
of the house—an arrangement which
seemed to point to amiable relationship. The
world wondered, but could do no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The feud between Meadowes and Simon Prior
had, owing to peculiar caution on Prior’s part,
never got abroad either; he preferred to be
still considered everywhere as Meadowes’ friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One night (it was the night of the 9th of
January, as Philip had afterwards reason
enough to remember) fortune drew together in
her net at a certain gaming-house, not a thousand
miles from Pall Mall, Richard Meadowes,
Philip, and Simon Prior. Phil and his father
met quite easily; their quarrel had not been so
serious as to make this the least difficult for
them; but the rest of the men there watched
the meeting with great curiosity. If they had
only known, they had better have turned their
scrutiny upon Meadowes’ meeting with Prior;
the cordiality with which these gentlemen met
might perhaps, to the observant and cynically-minded,
have given a key to their relations.
But there probably was no cynic in the company;
so Phil was the object of interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘My dear sir,’ said Phil, as he stood beside
his father, laying his hand on his shoulder,
‘you have surely come to town unexpectedly?
And but just in time to see me lose some
money, or I am mistaken. Yesterday I won
it—to-night (to make odds even) I am come to
lose to the same man. Come, you shall watch
our play, ’twill be fairish sport, I don’t doubt.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>They set them down—Phil and his opponent—and
a circle gathered round them to watch
their play. Philip played out of the sheerest
love of excitement, like a schoolboy, laughing
and jesting as he threw down his money, the
other man more gravely, pondering his cards.
The play ran high; Philip had staked and lost
all the money he had with him, and yet he
played on. It grew late.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Come, sir,’ he said, and he leant across the
table towards his father, with his sunny smile,
‘I must play schoolboy again and have my
father pay my debts.’ Meadowes, bewitched
like every one else, handed him over all the
gold pieces he carried, and thought himself
well paid by Phil’s smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Now I’ve cleared out my father,’ he said,
‘and myself, I’ll play you for my lace ruffles,
good ones they are; come on, sir,’ and he tore
off the ruffles carelessly enough, and flung
them on the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Now you’ll have my coat, ’tis a new silk
one—there it goes,’ he cried, flinging off the
fine garment in question, as he leant forward
with sparkling eyes to cut the cards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Lost again! My diamond shoe-buckles
now—there—you have them also? Gad! I’ll
be stripped before I’m done—well, the shoes
themselves. Lost them too!’ and with a shout
of laughter Phil flung down his cards and rose
from the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I must get home without my shoes and
without my coat!—I thank you; no, sir, I’d
like the sensation. We’ll taste the sweets of
poverty on a chill winter’s night for once—to
walk home with empty pockets, without a coat
or shoes. By George, that’s something new!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Phil, put on your coat; for all the world
you act like a child,’ laughed his father. And
Phil certainly looked babyish enough as he
stood there shoeless, in his ruffled cambric
shirt, laughing and careless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Phil would not be persuaded. The coat
was his no longer, said he, nor the shoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Come, sir, if you are going my way,’ he
said, bowing to his father, and they stepped
out into the passage together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘We may go so far in company,’ said Meadowes,
as they passed out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other men who had been in the room
waited to exchange comments on the father
and son, only Simon Prior, after a few minutes,
found that it was growing late, and he must
make his way homewards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went through the passage and looked out
into the inky darkness of the moonless January
night; the sky was of a bluish blackness, only
a shade less dense than the earth it canopied,
and unpierced by any star. Prior listened intently
for a moment, but no footsteps echoed
down the street. Great London was asleep in
these early morning hours, for it was nearing
three o’clock. Once and again as he walked
along Prior stopped to listen, then he bent
down and slipped off his shoes, crammed one
into each of the huge pockets of his long-skirted
coat, and with noiseless flying footsteps sped
down the street: the darkness received him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime Phil and his father were walking
together in the direction of St. James’ Square;
Phil, gay as was his wont when excited, was
pressing Meadowes to come home with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You have scarce seen me for months, sir,
and Carrie is a stranger to you,’ he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I cannot come to-night, Phil, mayhap to-morrow,’
said Meadowes, as they paused at the
corner where their ways parted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Carrie will think me lost; ’tis three of the
clock at the least,’ said Phil, and his father
laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You have not yet acquired that fine indifference
which comes with practice, Phil,’ he said.
‘You mention your wife with too palpable interest.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Maybe, maybe,’ laughed Phil, whose heart
indeed beat quicker at the sound of Carrie’s
name. He held out his hand then and bade
Meadowes good-night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Ah, Philip, Philip, if only you loved me!’
thought Meadowes, as he turned and walked
away down the dark street. Phil was going
home to the wife he adored, while he—how
bleak a loveless life like his was, to be sure!
There was not a human being that would mourn
his death—even Phil would not think twice of
it—more than that, ‘I believe he would welcome
it,’ he thought bitterly; ‘for all his
frankness and his charm he cares nothing for me:
I sometimes think he doth veritably hate me.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sad thoughts these on a winter’s night.
‘Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky, <span class='it'>thou dost not
bite so nigh</span>,’ he said, feeling the chill at his
heart. A moment later he heard a step behind
him, a light, unshod step, surely Phil returned.
Could it be? Think if Phil were to come beside
him in the darkness, touch his arm, speak
one kind word, say that now all would be right
between them! Surely even now the wilderness
would rejoice—would blossom as the rose—at
the coming of love. Surely he would
leave his old crooked ways, live even yet a
white, clean, straight year or two before all
was ended, return, if he might do no more, to
the attitude of heart that has at least a desire
for good!</p>

<p class='pindent'>These, and half a hundred more, thoughts
crowded through his fancy in that silly moment
of expectancy. But it was a moment so dear—like
the sudden thawing of a long frost—that
he dared scarcely break it. His voice was thick
with feeling when he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Why are you returned, Phil?’ he asked.
It was too dark to make out more than the outline
of the man’s head against the sky, but the
sound of his shoeless feet, as he walked alongside,
convinced Meadowes that Phil was there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Why are you returned?’ he questioned
again. There was no reply, then the man,
with a sudden, quick movement, drew his sword
and turned upon Meadowes, pinning him against
the wall. He fell almost without a groan.
The man knelt with one knee pressed down on
Meadowes’ chest, as if to squeeze his shortening
breaths out of him, and spoke loudly in his
ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘<span class='it'>I am Philip</span>,’ he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meadowes heard even through his clouding
senses the high bell-clear voice. ‘Is it—— Merciful
Lord! doth my Phil torment me for
my sins? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. his voice.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ah, surely
not Phil,’ he thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘<span class='it'>I am Philip</span>,’ repeated the man, rising
hastily; he dared not tarry even for the sweetness
of revenge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Philip, Philip!—Ah, undone, undone!’
murmured the dying man. He writhed over
on the pavement as the weight of his adversary’s
knee was lifted off him; pressed his
hand against his side as the last agony seized
him, and the spirit, driven so roughly from its
dwelling, lingered for a second on the threshold
and looked back. In that second fifty years
were reviewed like one day: childhood at
sweet Fairmeadowes among the fields, youth
and manhood, war and love and treachery, and
all the busyness of life, passed before him in a
flash. One remembrance stood out with extraordinary
clearness:—the memory of a prayer
offered long ago in one of the old City churches—a
strange, seemingly unanswered prayer.
Here, late in time, was its bitter answer. And
then this memory passed also, and one only
thought remained—Philip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this in a second’s time. In that second,
as the murderer rose to his feet, the glimmer of
a lantern fell into the pressing darkness, and a
hand appeared out of the gloom, clutched, and
held him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meadowes did not see the light. His eyes
were closed, but the one thought of Philip held
possession of his brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘<span class='it'>Run, Phil, run, lest this bring you to
trouble</span>,’ he cried with his latest breath; the
two struggling men could not choose but hear.
The watchman let fall his lantern and they
wrestled in the darkness, then with one great
wrench the other freed himself, and flung aside
his adversary, who fell heavily. It took him a
moment to rise, and then he stood stupidly for
a brief space to listen in what direction the
murderer ran. But even the silent street
scarcely echoed back the light footsteps of the
man wearing no shoes, as he scudded away
into the darkness.</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie had sat up late that night waiting for
Philip to come in, then she grew sleepy, went
to bed, and fell asleep. But her sleep cannot
have been very sound, for the heavy foot of the
watch who passed in the street below, and the
echo of his voice as he chanted out the hour,
wakened her widely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Three o’clock of a January night: a cold
dark night with no moon.’ He went under the
window and his footsteps died away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie rubbed her eyes, and saw that the fire
still burned brightly, lighting up the big room
with its heavy hangings and huge pieces of
furniture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Where can Phil be? why has he never
come in?’ asked Carrie, a little anxiously.
She sat up to listen if she could not hear any
sound in the house, tossing back her long red
curls over her shoulder. Yes, some one was
coming softly up-stairs; she knew the footstep
well. A minute later the door opened and
Philip came in. He wore no coat nor any
shoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Hullo, Carrie! are you too keeping a vigil?’
he said lightly, as he paused at the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Phil! where is your coat? and why are
you without shoes?’ cried Carrie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I played them away. I played the coat off
my back and the shoes off my feet. I scarce
ever before had such sport. And let me lie
down, Carrie, my dear, for I am dog tired.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with that Phil cast himself down on the
bed just as he was, rolled over on his side,
dragged the satin quilt over his shoulder, and
was asleep before the words were well said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie tried ineffectually to waken him.
‘You will catch a chill for certain, Phil,’ she
said; but Phil would not listen, so she fetched
a cloak and covered him with it as tenderly as
a mother might wrap up a sleeping child, then
lay down herself and tried to sleep. But she
was wakeful for long, and thought of many
things; of long ago, and the visit she had paid
Phil in that very room where he lay, in that
very bed, a sick and a very bad-tempered
child. How strange the turns of Fortune’s
wheel were, to be sure! Then she thought of
her father, and longed and longed to see him.
‘I believe he will find me somewhat altered.
I am become such a fine lady now-a-days,’
thought she, smiling in the darkness. At last
she fell asleep, and dreamed pleasant dreams of
meeting her father, and finding their quarrel
had all been a mistake; and then suddenly she
woke with a great noise going on down-stairs.
There came a terrific thunder at the outer door,
a confusion of voices, and then footsteps came
up the staircase. Then Peter’s voice threatening,
expostulating:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I’ll tell my master. Stand back! I tell
you you are mistook.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Phil,’ cried Carrie, shaking him lightly.
‘Phil, there is something wrong!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil grumbled in his sleep. But the next
moment the door was opened, and Peter, white
and agitated, entered the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Sir, sir, there is some mistake! For the
love of Heaven waken and come out here.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he spoke two men followed him into the
room, and one of them advanced to where Phil,
yawning and rubbing his eyes, sat up on the
edge of the bed, exclaiming impatiently to
Peter,</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘What the deuce is all this, Peter?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I arrest you in the King’s name,’ said one
of the men, and he laid his hand on Phil’s
shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil was wide awake at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘My good fellow,’ he said, ‘you are indeed
under some mistake, and you surely choose a
strange place where to arrest me, and show
little consideration for this lady’s feelings.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I’m sorry indeed, my lady,’ said the officer,
as he bowed to Carrie; ‘but my business is to
secure my prisoner.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil stood up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Of what crime am I accused, then, my good
fellow?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man hesitated—glancing at Carrie, but
Phil laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘My wife can hear aught I’m accused of,’
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘<span class='it'>Of the murder of Richard Meadowes</span>,’ said
the man low into Philip’s ear. He did not
mean Carrie to hear; but she, leaning forward,
caught the words. There was a moment’s dismayed
silence. Then Carrie shrieked aloud—three
sharp little screams, and fell back against
the pillows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Come,’ said Philip, ‘I am ready to go with
you.’ At the door he turned and came back
to where Carrie lay, white and scared, staring
after him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘ ’Tis some mistake, Carrie; have no fear,’
he said. ‘And, Peter, fetch me a coat and a
pair of shoes.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day wore on somehow for Carrie after
Phil’s arrest; she sat idle, hour by hour, looking
for news of him and getting none. Late in
the day she sent Peter out to make inquiries,
but when he returned it was to bring her very
scant comfort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘There was great excitement in town over
the murder; nothing was known, no news was
to be had,’ said Peter, but he concealed the
half that he had really heard on all sides.
Meantime Phil was detained for examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘In prison—Phil in prison!’ cried poor Carrie
incredulously. ‘Why, I thought to see
him back ere half an hour had gone. O Peter,
what can I do? ’Tis unbelievable.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter was dumb with distress; he did not
know what to think—the whole matter seemed
to him like an ugly dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Mayhap Mr. Philip will return home on
bail, madam,’ he said lamely, the only comfort
he could suggest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘But that any one should even suppose him
to have done it!’ sobbed Carrie. Ah, that
was the sting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Carrie was to weep many tears before
she saw the end of this sad matter.</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>The Courts were crowded on the day that
Philip Meadowes stood his trial at the Old
Bailey. The case attracted a vast deal of attention
in its day, and if all the cross-questioning
of Phil’s case were reported here, they would
make a ponderous volume, that no one would
ever finish. So the outlines of the trial must
suffice for the story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘<span class='it'>How say you, Philip Richard William
Meadowes, Are you Guilty of the felony and
murder whereof you stand indicted, or Not
guilty?</span>’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘<span class='it'>Not guilty.</span>’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘<span class='it'>How will you be tried?</span>’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘<span class='it'>By God and my country.</span>’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘<span class='it'>God send you a good deliverance.</span>’</p>

<p class='pindent'>So ran the time-honoured prelude; and the
listening crowds echoed the prayer, for Phil
made a very interesting prisoner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood in the dock and looked round him,
nodding to right and left as he recognised
friends among the crowd, as easy and self-possessed
as any man in the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no trace of anxiety on his face,
and he listened with interest and apparent unconcern
to the damning evidence brought
against him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The watchman came up for examination first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘May it please you, my Lord,’ said he, ‘this
is all I know of this matter; that on the night
of the 9th January, being a black dark night
from want o’ the moon, I came of a sudden
round the corner of —— Street, and was half
on top of something lying on the pavement before
that I well knew what I was about. A
man rose up from under my very feet, and,
guessing there was something amiss, I caught
at him, and we struggled a minute, but I’d to
let go my lantern and it went out in the falling.
That moment came a voice from the
ground, “<span class='it'>Run, Phil, run, lest this bring you
into trouble</span>,” and with a great blow the man
knocked me down and ran. I was a moment
rising, and I stood to listen which way he’d
gone, but I heard naught but the steps of a
man without shoes a-scudding down the street,
for all the world as you may have heard the
tail of a codfish flapping the flags o’ Billingsgate.
I followed after, but I lost him in the
darkness before I well knew. I came back to
see if aught could be done for the wounded
man, but he was going fast by then, and did
but breathe once or twice again, with never a
word—and, my Lord, I know no more.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Have you any notion of the hour?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘The hour was some ten minutes before three
o’ the clock.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘In what direction did the man run?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘He ran in the direction of St. James’
Square.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a little ripple of excitement
through the Court. Then Peter, looking older
by ten years, was brought into the witness-box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘At what hour did you open the door to
your master?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘At three o’ the clock, my Lord; the watch
had passed a moment before.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Did your master say anything to you on
coming in?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘He said, “I’m half asleep, like yourself,
Peter,” and passed on up the stairs.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was then brought forward a mass of
secondary evidence, as to the relations which
had existed between Philip and his father, and
so on. But even with this the trial did not
threaten to be a long one. No complications
seemed to spring up, the whole case was virtually
settled long before all these matters had
been gone into. The summing up came at
last:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Gentlemen of the Jury, you have heard a
long evidence; I shall now take notice of a
few points, which I think are the most material.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘The indictment against the prisoner at the
bar is for a very great crime: it is for murder,
and, moreover, for the murder of a parent.
You must now consider the evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You have heard that for some time past the
relations between the late Richard Meadowes
and his son have been somewhat strained; but
you have also heard evidence to-day, that on
the night of the 9th January they met with
apparent good feeling on both sides, that Meadowes
borrowed money of his father, and that
they went out together, apparently on good
terms. You have heard, gentlemen of the
Jury, that Meadowes, when he went out, wore
no shoes. The chain of evidence which we
have heard after this is curiously complete.
The watchman has told us that the murderer
who ran down the street wore no shoes, and
that the dying man called him “Philip” twice
by name, begging him to run for his life. You
have evidence that the murderer was discovered
at his horrid task, at ten minutes before three
of the clock, and that he ran in the direction
of St. James’ Square. The time which it
would take to go quickly between —— Street
and St. James’ Square is about ten minutes.
You have evidence that Meadowes came home
at three of the clock. Gentlemen, I am very
much puzzled in my thoughts, and am at a loss
to find out what inducement there could be to
draw Mr. Meadowes to commit such a horrid,
barbarous murder. For though he hath not
been on the best of terms with the late gentleman,
his father, yet the supposed cause of their
coolness—an imprudent marriage—is not a
cause likely to lead to such tragic happenings
as these. Nor can I see what Mr. Meadowes
would gain by the crime, were it not his own
undoing. But, against these considerations,
you must weigh the extraordinary evidence
which you have heard, and must judge whether
it be a likely case that another man, known to
Richard Meadowes as “Philip,” and wearing
no shoes, should have committed this crime. I
do not say more, gentlemen; there is little
more to say; go and consider your evidence,
and I pray God direct you in giving your verdict.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Jury were absent for a very short time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Gentlemen, are you all agreed in your verdict?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Yes.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Who shall say for you?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Foreman.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Philip Richard William Meadowes, hold up
thy hand.’ Which he did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Look upon the prisoner. How say you?
Is he Guilty of the murder whereof he stands
indicted, or Not guilty?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Guilty.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip listened, incredulous. Then, as the
truth forced itself in upon his mind, the injustice
and cruelty of fate overcame him. In his
wrath and bitterness he stood silent, then, with
a sudden hard bitter little laugh, and a dramatic
movement of his hand, he leant forward to
speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘My Lord,’ he said, ‘I am innocent of the
blood of this just man.’</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>The trial then was over. And it seemed indeed
that before very long Philip Meadowes’
life too would be over. He who had laughed
at imprisonment and laughed at trial could
laugh no longer; he was forced to believe at
last that the world held him to be a murderer,
and that as such he must die. But even sitting
in his cell, a man under sentence of death,
Philip could not realise it. This the end of
him? this, this, this? It was frankly impossible
that this could be the end of Philip Meadowes
and all his ambitions! of the beautiful
life he and Carrie had meant to live together,
of that passion clean and hot as flame that
burned between them! Impossible! impossible!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, even above this cry of the heart,
rose that keener note of anguish, that supreme
utterance of the soul, the terror of unfulfilment.
It lurks in every man, this protest of
vitality against encompassing and ever encroaching
mortality, and has its roots in life itself.
With most men the feeling is quite unformulated
and vague. ‘They would not like to be
altogether forgotten’ is about all that it
amounts to, and the fear, such as it is, finds
ready cure in the laws of their being; having
given hostages to Fortune they have no further
dread that their memory will perish—the next
generation will carry it on. But with another
type of man the case is very different; for
though the child of his body may be dearer to
him than his own flesh, the child of the soul
will be dearer yet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is this law of aspiration, effort, what you
will, that moves on our world at all; for
though it is not written that one man in a
thousand shall influence the race, or one in a
million leave an undying memory, yet it is
written that every man, though half of them
unknowingly, shall strive after some star, and
some even shall succeed. And these myriads
of agonising atoms form a great aggregate of
achievement out of all proportion to their puny
individual efforts, and slowly push the world on
in its destined course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something of all this came over Philip now;
above all his memories of this dear, warm,
wooing world, that had so loved and courted
him, came the agonising thought, ‘I am virtually
dead; I must depart, <span class='it'>leaving nothing behind</span>.’
With extraordinary vividness of sensation
he had lived; life had appeared to him as
a long feast of rich and varied good things to
which he had sat him down gaily. Some day
he had thought to rise from it, gird on his
armour, and go forth to some stirring and valorous
enterprise; he had never decided what the
enterprise would be, but trusted that the kind
and bountiful Giver of life’s banquet would provide
his children with work when they had
feasted long enough. Now all these vague
dreams of the future came down like a house of
cards: he stood face to face with death, his
work undone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the thought which eclipsed every
other as these strange days rolled on, each of
them it seemed an eternity for length, each of
them bringing Phil nearer and nearer to the
gallows. The very gaolers pitied Philip for
his youth and beauty; but they pitied Carrie
more that day she obtained entrance to Newgate
and a half-hour’s interview with her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil sat, as he always sat then, his eyes fixed
on the floor, his chin resting on his hands. He
did not even look up as the door was unlocked,
but said merely, ‘Lay it down, gaoler; I have
little appetite these days,’ thinking his food
had been brought in. Then with a cry, inarticulate,
between joy and agony, Carrie ran
towards him. Phil did not stir nor speak, and
Carrie knelt down beside him, and buried her
face against his shoulder, sobbing. He passed
his arm round her, but still he did not speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘O Phil! my darling, my joy, why can you
not speak to me?’ cried Carrie. She took his
hand in hers, and held it to her heart, kissing
it and crying over it; but Phil was silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he raised his eyes from the ground at
last and looked at her, Carrie started, such a
grave new look there was in them, and all the
shine seemed to have gone from them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘What will you do, Carrie?’ he said suddenly.
They were the first words he uttered.
‘Do you think your father will forgive you
when you are left alone? will take you back to
his home and care for you?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Don’t! don’t!’ cried Carrie; but Phil
went on—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I shall be hanged on the 12th of next month,
Carrie; there’s no chance of a reprieve, they’ve
tried for it in vain, the facts are too strong
against me. I wish ’twere sooner, even for
your sake, my poor darling. You’ll dream of
me being hanged each night twice over ere then.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie put her fingers in her ears. ‘Stop,
Phil! for Heaven’s sake do not say these
things,’ she cried; ‘they cannot kill you.
Have you stopped speaking now? May I take
my fingers from my ears?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Yes,’ laughed Philip. ‘Come, Carrie, tell
me, have you no doubt of your husband these
days when all the world calls him a murderer?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Phil!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Well, what do you make of it all—all this
evidence?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘How did it happen?’ asked innocent Carrie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I fear you know as much as I do. Prior
did it, I fancy; took off his shoes and followed
my father and killed him—that’s all I can
think, but there’s not a ghost of fact to go to
prove this. They had not even quarrelled, to
my knowledge at least.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘O Phil! don’t look like that! Oh, you
are not a boy any longer,’ said Carrie, for she
had caught the strange new expression of his
eyes again as he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I have been a boy too long,’ said Philip;
he shook his head and smiled at Carrie as if she
were a child; ‘and now I have grown old in a
night—like Jack’s bean-stalk. Come and let
me speak all my discontent to my love, and
years after this she will remember, and will
credit me with all I wished to do rather than
all I left undone.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie looked up wonderingly, and Philip
spoke on—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Oh, that’s the bitterness, Carrie; it’s not
a shameful death, or leaving the happy world
even—and hasn’t it been happy! No; I’d
stand that if I left anything behind. But just
to go out like a candle—phew!’—he blew into
the air as if at a flame,—‘bright one minute,
snuffed out the next. ’Tis ghastly. I cannot
realise, it, Carrie; I won’t—I won’t, ’tis miserable
injustice.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil rose and paced about the cell for a moment,
then he came and sat down beside Carrie
again, and took her hand in his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You don’t understand, you know, my heart,’
he said with something of his old lightness for
a moment; ‘for I scarce think you ever felt
thus. You now, if you were to die along with
me, would not feel a pang, I believe.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘No, indeed, Phil; I should die gladly with
you,’ said Carrie, mystified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Ah, there’s the rub. I cannot die, Carrie;
my personality cries out so loud against extinction
ere it hath fulfilled itself. Foolish, vain
talk; but I’ve thought of no other thing night
and day since they passed sentence on me, except
of you.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie, you know, was of another clay; she
sat and looked at Phil with such a puzzled air
that he fairly laughed aloud, and his ringing
laugh struck strangely on the walls of Newgate.
The poor old walls had heard many a
groan, but so few laughs that the sound was
scarcely recognised!</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Did I puzzle her dear brains with nonsense?’
he said, taking Carrie’s face between his hands
and kissing her. ‘Carrie, our jesting days are
over, and sweet, sweet they’ve been for all
their shortness.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘O Phil, they cannot be over,’ said Carrie;
she was only twenty, poor child, an age that
has little realisation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Carrie, you must believe this,’ said her husband—he
looked into her eyes as he spoke, and
let his words fall slowly,—‘I shall be both
dead and buried this day next month—dead
and buried, Carrie, and you will be a widow.
You must face this, must talk with me of what
you are to do afterwards.’ But Carrie would
only shudder and hide her face in her hands.
Phil spoke on—a curious task to set his eloquence
this—telling her unflinchingly all that
would be, explaining, describing, till Carrie
whitened and clutched his hand more tightly
than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Stop, Phil,’ she said, in a little choked
whisper, ‘I believe it now.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then with a rattle of the bolts the door fell
open, and the gaoler silently signed to Carrie
that she must say her farewells.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I shall be allowed to see you once again,
Phil,’ she whispered, before she turned away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie’s coach had been waiting for her at
the prison gate all this time. And when she
came out, Peter stepped forward to assist her.
Carrie got in, and then sat staring before her
in a bewildered fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Shall we drive home, madam?’ asks Peter,
his voice very husky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘To——. Yes—to my father’s,’ said Carrie.</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>In this moment of dismay Carrie’s heart had
turned to her father, as the needle turns to the
north, with a tenacity of trustfulness that a
thousand quarrels would never shake. Here,
if anywhere, lay her help, her comfort. She
alighted at the door of her old home and passed
in without waiting to inquire of Patty whether
her father was at home or no. Her trouble
would be her passport; she made sure of welcome
now, if it had been refused to her in her
prosperity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dusk had fallen, but firelight lit up the
room as Carrie entered; it shone brightly on
the polished panelling of the walls with rosy
reflection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sebastian had just come in; he stood beside
the fire; his great figure in the half light
seemed to fill the little room. Carrie ran towards
him with her arms outstretched and a cry
of joy; the sight of him came to her in her distress
like the very peace of heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Save him! save him, dada!’ she cried,
turning back in her extremity to her childish
speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Eh, my poor Carrie!—so trouble hath come
to you,’ said Sebastian, ‘and so you are come
to me.’ He paused, and looked curiously at
his daughter as he spoke. Carrie had changed
so much since they parted; in her splendid
raiment, her jewels and her laces, she looked
such a great lady that Sebastian scarcely recognised
her. But Carrie was oblivious of everything,
save the one thing at her heart. She
caught both Sebastian’s hands in hers, and
cried again and again, ‘Save him, dada! Oh,
sir, they’re going to hang him—to hang my
Philip; he’ll hang ere the month is out if you
do not save him.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sebastian sat down and Carrie knelt beside
him; there was no word of dispute between
them now; she gazed up into his face in
an agony of entreaty, an ecstasy of confidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I feared ’twould go badly from the first,’
said Sebastian. ‘Have you seen your husband,
Carrie, since the sentence?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Yes, this afternoon. Oh, sir, ’tis impossible
that Phil can die.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘And what doth he say—how explain this
murder to you—to his wife?’ asked Sebastian
curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘He says Simon Prior—(a man, sir, that I
always hated, a man I made Phil quarrel with
not long ago)—he says Simon Prior must have
done it, else he can offer no explanation.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘And you—do you not think your husband
did it, Carrie?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie drew back from her father for a moment
in horror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Sir!’ she began—but added a moment
later—‘but that is because you do not know
Phil.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Carrie,’ said Sebastian, leaning forward to
take her hand in his, ‘tell me, my child, my
joy, the better part of life for me—tell me, are
you as happy with Philip as you thought to be?
do you love him as first you did? for youthful
passions are hot, and many a time burn themselves
out.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I love him more a thousand times than when
first I loved.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘And you believe no ill of him?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘As soon I would believe it of you, sir.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sebastian rose and began to pace up and
down the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Have they tried for a reprieve, Carrie?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Vainly, sir.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie sank down, burying her face in the
cushions of her father’s chair, and Sebastian
paced through the room in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A scheme was already in his mind which
would easily enough gain Philip’s release; but
whether to do it? Even the sight of Carrie
kneeling there in such an abandonment of grief
could not move him. Willingly he would see
Philip Meadowes die: an offence to him in the
very circumstances of his birth; the son of his
bitter enemy; himself the man who had stolen
Carrie from him—how was it possible that he
should work for Philip’s release? Moreover,
Philip was a murderer; Carrie might dotingly
believe in his innocence—to the world he stood
accused; it would be plainly wrong and unprincipled
to assist at the reprieve of such a
man. No, he would not do it, would never
suggest the possibility to Carrie, to any one.
Philip should die, and Carrie would return to
her father’s house, and they would bury the
past in the grave that closed over Richard
Meadowes and his son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So argued Sebastian, as he paced up and
down the quiet fire-lit room; then the silence
became full of voices—the past sung and whispered
to his heart; he was young again, and
Annie was with him. Annie seemed now to
speak so clearly that she might have been pacing
beside him—she spoke always the same
words, pleading with him for something with
all her soul:—‘<span class='it'>If ever you can help my Phil
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for my sake .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and forgettin’ Dick Sundon
and all his lies.</span>’ She urged again and yet
again. The time had come in truth; if ever
Phil wanted a helper, he wanted one now, and
yet Sebastian held back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Don’t ask it of me, Annie!’ he cried out
aloud, forgetful of Carrie’s presence in the fierceness
of the mental struggle he was going
through. Carrie sat up in surprise at the sound
of his voice, and hearing a name she did not
know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Did you speak, sir?’ she asked. Her voice
woke him to the present, to the realities of
things, and his decision was taken in a moment.
How had he ever questioned?—he had promised
Annie once and for ever to help her son if it
ever lay in his power to do so; worthy or unworthy,
as Phil might be, that promise must
be kept for the sake of the woman who had
trusted him. Sebastian flung out his arms with
a gesture of relief—like a man who has been
long cramped. In the sudden rebound from
the tense feeling of the last few minutes, he
fairly laughed aloud, then bending over Carrie
he raised her face to his, and kissed her wet
blue eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Come, sweetheart,’ he said. ‘Take courage,
mayhap we shall save him yet.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie held her breath, and Sebastian continued:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘My Lady Y—— suffers from an obscure
disease of the finger-joints.’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He paused
and looked at Carrie for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I scarce see how my Lady Y——’s finger-joints
affect my husband’s release, sir,’ pouted
Carrie, who thought that her father had taken
a sudden and rather unfeeling divergence into
his own affairs at this point; but her tears were
dried none the less; she listened breathlessly
for what Sebastian was going to say next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I have an idea the cure would be simple
enough,’ said Sebastian. ‘I’ve seen more of
what can be done with cutting than most men,
and I’m not afraid of the knife.—Come, Carrie,
mayhap we can cut this knot yet.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘How? what?’ queried Carrie, mystified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Plainly, I’ll operate on your husband if he
hath a mind to give a hand for his life, and an
hour of agony.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie had heard—as what surgeon’s daughter
of that day had not heard?—of many a
criminal who owed his life to her father’s lancet.
It was not an uncommon means of escape
from the gallows, though the horror of it made
it in every case a last resort. The difficulty of
obtaining subjects for operation in those days
was such that the surgeons considered themselves
lucky when they could get some hapless
prisoner to buy his life at their hands. As I
say, many a tale of the kind Carrie had heard,
yet she whitened now as she realised all that
the plan involved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Tush, Carrie,’ laughed her father, patting
her white cheek. ‘Many’s the man hath gone
through worse at my hands. Ask your old
friend Cartwright how I took off his arm, and
he’s here still to tell the tale.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Ugh,’ shuddered Carrie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Come, I had not thought to see my daughter
a coward,’ urged Sebastian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Will—will you arrange about it, sir?’ said
Carrie faintly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I shall see the authorities—then Philip; I
have no fear of his refusing: all that a man
hath will he give for his life, Carrie.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Will it be very bad, sir?’ asked Carrie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Well, I’ll scarce guarantee him a pleasant
hour,’ laughed Sebastian. ‘The last I had
under my hands from Newgate made noise
enough to deafen one; the one before that had
made himself as drunk as a lord, which was
wiser in him for certain.’ Poor Carrie, treated
to these details—for it was a robust age,—shivered
and felt sick with horror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Sir, sir, be quiet!’ she cried, with her
fingers in her ears, and Sebastian laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Send your coach home, Carrie, and stay
with me,’ he said; ‘where else would you
stay, now you are in trouble?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Will you have me, sir?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Till brighter days return, my daughter.’</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>I never enter an old house without wishing it
had a voice and could tell me all its stories and
secrets; but the secrets of Newgate would be
such as none of us would listen to willingly—I
think we would stop our ears and hasten on
were these stones to cry out! Nevertheless
one of the Newgate cells could tell of a sunny
morning long ago when Caroline Meadowes,
Sebastian Shepley, and their friend, Dr. Munro,
came together to aid at the release of Carrie’s
husband. Philip needed all his light-heartedness
that day, for though liberty was drawing
near, he was to gain it by a dark enough entrance.
As he stood beside the window and
looked out into the sunshiny world where men
walked free and happy, his thoughts were bitter
enough; one man, at least, thought he, walked
free that day who should not! Then the door
was thrown open, and Carrie and her father
came in, followed by Dr. Munro. Carrie was
white as a lily, her blue eyes shone like stars;
she ran towards her husband and clasped his
hands—she could not speak, poor child. Sebastian
wore his usual air of decision and cheerfulness;
Munro looked with some curiosity at the
three people brought together for such a strange
purpose. Philip was the first to speak, coming
forward with his graceful address to greet
Sebastian, as though no disagreement had ever
been between them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘My dear sir,’ he said, ‘I have no words in
which to express my indebtedness to you.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke with so much of his father’s air and
voice that Sebastian had almost recoiled from
his outstretched hand, but, recollecting himself,
he took it as cordially as might be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘This is my friend Dr. Munro,’ he said,
‘who hath come to see us through with this
ticklish business.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘And hath Carrie come for the same end?’
asked Phil, as he turned to his wife and laughed;
‘I think ’twill be better for her to wait elsewhere
till we are done with the matter.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘So thought I,’ said Sebastian, ‘but so did
not think Carrie. Two hours of fatherly eloquence
have I wasted on her this day already,
and she hath turned a deaf ear to it all. Come
she would, and stay she will, so there’s an end
of it. But this I say, the first sound she
makes, or tear she sheds, she goes from the
room.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Carrie, my sweet, better far go elsewhere
and wait; ’twill not be long. I fear you’ll
find it painful to watch this,’ said Phil, but
Carrie shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Let me stay, Phil; ’twould be harder far
not to be near you. I shall not cry nor scream,
believe me; I shall be quiet all the time.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Carrie is no coward in truth,’ said her father
proudly. ‘Best give her her own way, Meadowes,
as she seems determined in it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘As you please, sir,’ he said; and there was
a moment of ominous pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Come,’ said Sebastian; ‘off with your coat,
Meadowes; the quicker we get to work the
better.’ He turned up his own sleeves as he
spoke, and Munro opened out the instruments
he carried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip flung off his coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Which arm, sir? left, I hope?’ he asked,
beginning to roll up the shirt-sleeve off his left
arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Left,’ said Sebastian shortly; ‘now lie
down and we’ll be as quick as may be. Gad!
a fine arm it is, and a fine hand—well, say farewell
to it, my man, for ’twill not be fair again,
I fear.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>He ran his fingers down Phil’s strong young
arm as he spoke. Carrie, who stood beside
him, heard him mutter something under his
breath. ‘<span class='it'>Flesh of her flesh, bone of her bone</span>,’
he said, and Carrie with the self-importance of
youth, concluded that her father spoke of her
oneness with Philip; she thought of the wedding
service: ‘He should have said, “they
twain shall be one flesh,” ’ she thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Go on,’ said Phil; and Sebastian cut sharply
into the white flesh. Carrie whitened and
shuddered as she saw the first drop of blood—the
price of a life—redden her father’s lancet.
Then she went over to Phil’s side, and took his
right hand in hers and held it fast. Every
moment she felt it thrill and twitch, but Phil
gave no other sign of what he suffered. Sebastian
and Munro, intent on their work, bent over
him with a word now and then to each other—it
was something in these days to have live
tissue to operate on: and poor Philip, between
them, suffering the torments of Hades, lay
there wondering how long he could hold out,
for every second seemed an eternity of pain.
At first mere strength supported him, then
strength of will, then strength of love, then,
when all these resources had failed him, Philip
groaned aloud, and fell into blissful forgetfulness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Poor fellow!’ muttered Sebastian. He
glanced across at Carrie; she did not stir a
muscle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘We will not be long now, madam,’ said
Munro, with pity for her white face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘There—he hath paid dearly for—for life,’
said Sebastian a few minutes later; ‘and I
doubt, Munro, my Lady Y——’s courage will
not bear her through the same!’ And both
the men laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil came to himself slowly; and lay white
and trembling, his face drawn with pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘When you feel able, Philip,’ said Sebastian,
in a voice as kind as a mother’s, bending down
to speak to him, ‘I shall take you back to my
house—you and Carrie; ’twill be home for you
now.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip just smiled and closed his eyes, and
wondered vaguely how Dr. Shepley ever got
his voice to sound so soft; but Carrie, crossing
over to where her father stood, buried her face
on his breast and wept her long restrained tears.</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>Carrie, Philip, and Sebastian formed a curious
little household for the next few weeks. Sebastian,
who was first a doctor and then a man,
deferred his judgment upon Philip’s case in the
meantime, and directed his energies to Philip’s
recovery. This, with a vigorous young constitution,
was not very prolonged, and he was
soon going about as usual, only with the maimed
hand in a sling. Then, and not till then, Sebastian
began to study Philip’s character very carefully.
He would sit in silence and look at the
young man, puzzling what the truth of this
strange business was. For the life of him
Sebastian could not resist the charm of Phil’s
manner, and found himself unconsciously joining
in his jests and his talk; but every one did
that—what surprised him much more was to
find that he esteemed Philip in his more serious
moments. When Philip chose to be serious he
was terribly in earnest, compelling attention to
his subject, and Sebastian could scarcely believe
the evidence of his senses when first he heard
him speak in this way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was one evening as the two men sat alone
together, Carrie having gone out of the room,
that Philip began to speak of the future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You know, sir,’ he said, ‘I must begin to
earn my living—I cannot let you support my
wife, far less myself, and I do not suppose that
the fortune which my father meant to leave me
can be mine now. Even if it were, I scarce
think I could touch it while all the world supposes
me to be his murderer.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sebastian was silent for a moment, and Phil
turned quickly and looked at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Do you think I did that, sir?’ he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘If you did, you have the most extraordinary
easy conscience of any man I have ever met,’
said Sebastian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil gave a light little sigh. ‘Well, sir, ’tis
more than generous of you to house a murderer,
even for the sake of your dear daughter.—But
to return to what I spoke of first. Murderer
or no, I cannot let another man work for me
and be idle myself, yet I fear, with the stigma
that’s on me now, I can scarce hope for success
in any profession here. Sir, do you think
I should leave England and make a home for
my wife elsewhere?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Yes,’ said Sebastian slowly; ‘I fear ’tis
your only chance. But leave Carrie with me
meantime—a living, far less a competency, is
none so easy to make, as you’ll find when you
begin to try to make one.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Oh, I’ve been deucedly rich!’ cried Phil.
‘I should have been working years ago; but
I’ll work now like twelve men, sir, to make up
for lost time. Tell me, sir, isn’t work a splendid
thing? Now, when I see you each day
with more than you can overtake, I wish from
my heart I’d belonged always to those that
toil. Some fraction of it all must live, you
know, even of work like yours, sir, that appears
to be only from day to day, ’tis really moving
the world on. Our horrible idle days are dead
before they are half lived!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I never saw you in earnest before, Philip,’
said Sebastian, with a smile for the heat of
youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘You see—pardon me—you have not seen
very much of me,’ said Phil; ‘but I must be
in earnest now: Heaven knows I’ve played
myself long enough. ’Tis true I enter into life
halt now,’ he added, in a sadder tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was not the last conversation they had
on this much-vexed subject of what Phil was
to do; but things took on a different complexion
suddenly, one night not long after.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There came a thunder upon the knocker and
a note from Dr. Munro. It was dated from a
house in —— Street, and contained only these
words: ‘Do your endeavour to come as speedily
as may be, bringing with you Philip Meadowes.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sebastian could not explain the strange summons.
He passed the note to Philip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Simon Prior lives there,’ said Phil, as he
looked at the address.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Will you come, then?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Yes, sir; I fancy he hath business with
me,’ said Phil. When they reached the house,
Munro met them on the stairway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Come this way,’ he said, leading them into
a sitting-room. He closed the door and signed
to them to sit down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘This is the house of Simon Prior, the same
who witnessed at your trial,’ he said, with a
bow towards Philip. ‘And Simon Prior is
taken with seizures that threaten to end his
days ere long. Years ago he came under my
hands in hospital (do you remember, Shepley?
no, why should you?) from a street accident.
He seemingly thought me skilful, for now he
sends for me again, and this time the case is
scarce so easy. Now, since I have been called
in, the man has seemed in great trouble of mind—a
more arrant coward I never knew—and he
takes no rest day nor night, tossing and crying
out. Since this afternoon he calls continually
to see you, “Philip Meadowes,” and moreover
hath made me send by special messenger summoning
Judge Matthews to his bedside. His
Lordship is not yet arrived, mayhap he will not
trouble himself to come, but I have told him
that the summons may have special bearings on
a certain interesting case he lately tried, so I
look to see him shortly.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip said nothing; but he turned his sparkling
eyes on Sebastian for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Doth Prior wander in his mind then?’ said
Sebastian, a little anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘No, he fears death and judgment apparently,
but when the terrors pass off him, he is in full
possession of his senses.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘And he seems anxious to see Philip?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘After a fashion. At first he seemed to
struggle long about the matter, then asked me
if death was near, inevitably, for him, and
when I replied that it was, he said, after a
pause for thought, “Then send for Philip
Meadowes.” ’Twas after that he summoned
Judge Matthews, seemingly an afterthought.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>They heard at this moment the sound of
Matthews’ arrival in the hall. Munro went
out to meet him and usher him in. Philip
found himself again in the presence of his
Judge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘A good evening to you, gentlemen,’ said
Matthews. Phil drew himself up proudly
and met his surprised look with a steady
glance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘I fancy we are about to hear a curious statement
from Mr. Simon Prior, my Lord,’ said
Munro, ‘but before we go into his chamber I
had best tell you of his condition. ’Tis critical
to a degree, but his mind is clear still. The
thoughts that distract him come, I fancy, from
an evil conscience, so I have troubled you to
come at his bidding and hear whatever he hath
to say, in hopes that his mind being put at rest,
his bodily state may be bettered. Gentlemen,
shall we go into the sick-room?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>They followed Munro into a large dim-lighted
room, a silent, curious trio.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Simon Prior at sound of their footsteps
started up on his elbow, and peered into the
dimness of the shadowy room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Are they come? are all come? Is Philip
Meadowes come, and Shepley, and Judge Matthews?’
he said, in an anxious, loud voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘All are come, sir; calm yourself and lie
back. My Lord here is willing to hear aught
you may have to say,’ said Munro, laying Prior
back against the pillows. Matthews stepped
forward and stood beside the bed, but at sight
of him Prior started up again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘The Judge! the Judge!’ he cried, ‘and
before day shines I’ll stand before the Judge
of All!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Sir, sir, compose yourself,’ said Matthews,
as he took a seat by the side of the bed and laid
his hand kindly enough across the coverlet.
‘I am come to hear your story; take your
time, I shall listen, however long it may be.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Easily told, easily,’ said Prior. He seemed
to have strung himself up to tell all his story,
for he rattled it off now like a schoolboy who
repeats his letters. ‘Easily told—just that I
did it—killed Richard Meadowes. I took off
my shoes and followed him, trusting to the
dark night. Oh, it was all as easy as could
be. Then I told him I was Philip—just for
vengeance—just because Phil was the only
thing he loved on earth, and I wished to make
his heart bleed at the last. “I am Philip,” I
said in this high voice’—(he broke out into it
as he spoke)—‘just as Philip there speaks—and
Meadowes believed me. He died believing it.
Oh, I paid him out for his treachery, for a
thousand treacheries, and he thought his own
boy had turned traitor at the last! And I’m
glad I did it, for he had thrown me over like
an old shoe when I had served his turn. Oh,
sin’s easy, easy; nothing so easy as sinning at
the first, but now, how am I to die? how am
I to die?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tossed himself back against the pillows,
his arms flung above his head. Philip came forward
and stood looking pityingly down at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Now you have cleared me of this crime,
Prior,’ he said, ‘let your mind be easy of that.
I am here alive and well, as you see. You have
my forgiveness, if that is any comfort to you.
Is this all you have to tell us?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘All? all?—that’s but the end of a hideous
story; the beginning was so long ago I scarce
remember it. Always money, money. There
was the matter of Anne Champion; but he
was to pay every debt I had, you know, and I
was hard pressed at the time. Lord lay not
that sin to my charge! ’Twas Meadowes’ sin,
not mine; and there was that other affair in
the year ’24 that——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘There,’ said Phil, turning away, ‘I for one
have heard all I wish to hear.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Prior talked on:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘There was the matter of Anne Champion,
as I said; listen, Philip, for she was your
mother, you know, and you, Shepley, you were
her lover once, you remember; come, and I
shall tell you all of that I——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Sir, sir,’ said Phil in a low quick whisper
to Sebastian, and he pointed to the door. They
passed out together, with the sound of Prior’s
voice still talking on and on as they closed the
door. In silence they passed down the staircase
and out into the silent street. They stood
together there for a moment without speaking.
Then Sebastian laid his hand on Phil’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Come, my son,’ he said.</p>

<hr class='tbk'>

<p class='pindent'>Phil and Carrie were perhaps the happiest
man and woman in London that night. And
Sebastian Shepley, watching their joy, entered
into it and saw in them the bright end of a
dark story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ah, untraceable jugglery of Time, and
Change, and Fate! In all the arts of the conjurer
is no trickery like this; from pain and dishonour
and treachery, and broken hearts and
blighted hopes, from such a soil life sends up
her fresh and vigorous shoots, the immortal
blossomings of the tree that cannot wither,
whose leaves shall surely, at some far-off day,
heal the nations!</p>
